adults who don`t need to run complicated programs","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a dual-core Celeron Chromebox which is basically a desktop Chrome OS device,  I would primarily use this if you

add the cellphone charging port is a huge bonus","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio was purchased with a certain degree of skepticism, assuming it was a another example of an over-hyped tech

NOAA receiver and radio charger area light it's the real deal","positive":1},{"review":"  First off, the seller just threw this radio in a plastic bag, Would have given five stars without these issues

Maker","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchase this Chromebook for school, and I am loving it so far, Overall I would recommend this device","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, I really like this Chromebook, Samsung should have either 1) designed the second USB-C port further away from the first one on the left side of the device, or 2) designed the second USB-C port on the right side of the

definitely recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  My son needed a replacement Chromebook, so I picked this one up on \"Prime Day\",  For those that know chromebooks, you know what that means","positive":0},{"review":"  Using this computer as a work computer during the pandemic, I found that it would get sluggish after a while with a number of tabs open (15 or so, running apps like slack, office365, webex, VDI, gmail, google drive), to the point where I would have to reboot at least daily, At just under $500, it's a question if there isn't a cheaper chromebook out there that

irritating","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for a computer for everyday use and used to have a MacBook Pro, My only critique is that the computer cant connect on airplanes because most

process since the box was slightly damaged when received","positive":0},{"review":"  I was just casually using photoshop in a dry environment on 50% battery and suddenly the screen goes black and never turns back on,Fun to use, but would not recommend","positive":0},{"review":"  I had the surface pro 4 before this one and still worked great,In conclusion: my surface pro 4 works better, except for the surface pen + touch screen","positive":0},{"review":"  Great product, I look forward to loading my sheet music as pdf files and using the screen while I play the piano","positive":1},{"review":"  First a big Thumbs-up to ProPrime and FedEx who shipped my Surface Pro 7 to the other side of the globe within 4 days of ordering - very impressed,Very handy tool when meeting with clients","positive":1},{"review":"  All was fine until one day it kept flickering on the start up Logo, I'll try another, hopefully I'll get a good one","positive":1},{"review":"  The screen is perfect size for using it as a tablet and is a okay size for using it as laptop,","positive":1},{"review":"  When I first got the surface I was worried that it would be a dud based on other customer reviews especially considering how cheap it was, The last surface pro I had was from 2016 and it still runs pretty smoothly so I'm hoping this one lasts just as long, if not longer","positive":1},{"review":"  Pro7 is basically the best laptop and tablet combined,I totally like this thing","positive":1},{"review":"  I liked that the product was exactly as advertised,

top 2 inches of the screen,3 says later and still waiting for them to approve the replacement","positive":0},{"review":"  This is really a nice product, I wish I could have justified the cost because I like a bigger screen normally the Go is only 10\" compared to the Pro which is 12\"","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased two of these at the same time at Christmas for my sons,  AVOID and do not buy","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had experience with Surfaces, the freezing or not coming out of sleep is a fairly common issue,  It's a nice little machine, if you can get one that doesn't have

value for money other than to say it appears to be a bad deal","positive":0},{"review":"  There was no type cover as advertised and the seller wouldn't resolve this when I contacted them, The tablet itself seems okay so far but I had to buy my own type cover and the seller only refunded me fifteen dollars","positive":0},{"review":"  Battery dies in standby, basically making it a useless product, Maybe","positive":0},{"review":"  Dislikes: little laggy: Microsoft need to improve the software so it can compeit with other tables, Dead pixel: the screen quality not good and windows tests size not fit for this type of screen sizes,Likes: light weight and small size, easy during transportation, affordable price","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this tablet with the intention of using it

this  Emergency-Hand-Crank-Radio, I would give this 0 star if I could","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased 8 units as gifts to give away to members of my search and rescue team, This was a little disappointing because AM could be a source of local news updates in your area during a crises","positive":0},{"review":"  I had a power outage for 24hrs after getting this, Do not bother buying unless you just want a flashlight and radio","positive":0},{"review":"  There are some pros and cons to this radio, as too many things,Overall, for the money, I guess an ok emergency radio but certainly

register","positive":1},{"review":"  This little thing is pretty good, especially if your working on a small budget bug out bag, I feel this would be great for either a bug out bag, or even hiking and

nice port selection, USB C, touchscreen, good battery life, backlit keyboard-this laptop doesn't have any of these) The built is kinda cheap, the screen is not as terrible as the other reviews state

are really going to enjoy the Stream Deck","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0Ordered from Amazon and Downloaded and Installed software before package arrived,I don't stream, so for its intended purpose, i can't say how good it is, but for creatives in the Adobe ecosystem, it would mesh well with Palette Controllers or give you the few extra buttons that the Loupedeck lacks","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this on a whim when I saw it on sale, Their examples are all things gamers will understand but non-gamers will understand well

day","positive":1},{"review":"  Forget streaming, this device is a GREAT tool if your work at a computer and perform a lot of repetitive tasks, or simply have trouble remembering hotkeys,A little pricey for what it is still, in my opinion, but I honestly wish I had gotten it sooner, based on the impact it is having on my work","positive":1},{"review":"  This was purely a lark, But in the penguin world, it's a game-changer for productivity so long as you have the skill and time to invest in making it yours","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0So I've had the regular 15 key StreamDeck for a long time and was really excited to see this StreamDeck XL announced,Overall I'm not happy with the fact that the unit is essentially useless after little more than a month and customer service at Elgato doesn't seem to be the greatest","positive":0},{"review":"  Just my luck, I love this product before I even got it, Very poor quality and support to match","positive":0},{"review":"  Let me first and foremost say that I am not a streamer or video related professional, It's cleaner than some hacked together solution and easier than remembering complicated key combos","positive":0},{"review":"  WHAT A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT TO FIND OUT THAT ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING PRODUCTS FOR STREAMERS ALL OVER THE WORLD IS FREAKING LIMITED TO THE LAST AND MOST INTRUSIVE WINDOWS VERSION OUT THERE, MAKE SURE THAT AMAZON MAKE THE WARNING A BIT MORE OBVIOUS AND TELL THE WORLD THAT IT WOULD ONLY WORK ON WINDOWS 10 AND NO OTHER WINDOWS BELOW","positive":0},{"review":"  If it worked all the time, it would be great,  Functionally, when it works, it's very good, however, it does NOT work most of the time","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had this thing for about a week,

recommend to anyone","positive":0},{"review":"  Sure you can have macros and keys setup to do certain things for you, like links, or opening programs, commands, web sites, or launching programs etc, but this does it so well, and in style,","positive":0},{"review":"  I wish this unit came with more built-in documentation, but it follows the modern era of having virtually no included documentation and directing you to download stuff, even the manuals,  They could make a lot of people happy by switching software driver engineers who can make a product that will work with earlier Windows versions","positive":0},{"review":"  Extremely angry, I will never buy one of these through Amazon again and may never buy any of their products","positive":0},{"review":"  Had the Stream Deck for a few days now and I gotta say im really impressed so far,)Fast response time within stream deck and between the deck and PCOn Off hotkeys will light up dim when on or off on the stream deckCons:Lack of

awesome","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0Powerful tool if you are a streamer with its integration to obs and steam labs obs ( as well as others) but still useful even if you don`t stream, Overall

personal purchase at full price","positive":1},{"review":"  This is ridiculously easy to use, and is extremely convenient, $150 isn't cheap, but the product is worth it imo","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been hesitant on purchasing an Elgato Stream Deck for quite some time because I didn't think it'd be worth the money,This review is completely unbiased and the Stream Deck was purchased with my own money","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a review of the Elgato Stream Deck (USB 2,As with all my reviews, I will update this review should this develop any issues with ongoing use","positive":1},{"review":"  Let me first stat to say that I did not purchase Stream Deck for gaming purposes, I highly recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0The Elgato Stream Deck is a MUST for Content Creators, not just for streamers because there so much that you can do, I use this for when I'm streaming and using applications like Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Audition, basically whenever I'm editing and making a video (makes it a lot easier with the shortcuts)","positive":1},{"review":"  We had never used anything like this for our streaming and we were kind of leery of purchasing this because we didn't know what the heck we were doing,","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s a pain in the posterior to do anything other than gaming, and for the application I most wanted to use it with, Adobe Lightroom, it`s virtually useless, Maybe some day I`ll have the time to figure out how to get something out of it, but I bought it to improve productivity, not force me to master another arcane device or memorize more strings of random numbers that are shortcuts , that sort of task set  no longer interests me","positive":0},{"review":"  UPDATE - January 24th 2020, Giving this 3 stars after the differnt models came out and also bewarw of having the screens on all the time, So go look up people's reviews on videos and I bet this is your next buy and so worth it","positive":0},{"review":"  hooked it up and it looked great set up my first icon, total waste of money","positive":0},{"review":"  I thought this thing was going to solve all my problems, but it only introduced new ones, Maybe it's just me as I do have a tendency to find bugs easily, but this thing is not worth the stress","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this to pair with an atem mini after reading some reviews about it o line being able to become a switcher of sorts,  And even then maybe go for the bigger one if you like it","positive":0},{"review":"  As a very happy owner of many Elgato Stream Deck units (6 and counting), I'm extremely bummed to see that my brand new Stream Deck XL has a bad yellow cast over the entire screen (all the buttons),but for now, I'm bummed","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is useful and definitely a cool addition to any desktop, But at full price, it may be a bit much","positive":0},{"review":"  It was easy to set up and I was very satisfied with it, but it stopped working day 2,I contacted customer support about this issue but I have not heard back from them so far and I doubt they'll have a better fix than a replacement, so I will probably return this and get myself something less error-prone instead","positive":0},{"review":"  I got a defective unit, bottom right corner button gets stuck (as if to be pressed without letting go, so instead of \"b\" I get \"bbbbbbbbbb\" this because a serious issue pending what hotkey I assign to it, Hopefully my replacement will not have these issues and I will amend my  review and improve the rating","positive":0},{"review":"  The ElGato Stream deck is great, has revolutionized my streaming workflow, But I don't think I will buy from this seller again","positive":0},{"review":"  So a lot of people ask, why should I pay 150 bucks for what is essentially a macros keypad, Corsair was quick to respond and sent me a replacement quickly","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a programmer, and my editors have many actions that can be triggered using key combinations,Worth every penny","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm normally to lazy to write Amazon reviews, but I'm so impressed with this thing I felt obliged,  I can't recommend this thing enough","positive":1},{"review":"  While the Stream Deck is marketed towards people who want to control their livestreams (a task at succeeds at perfectly - one software install and nothing else was all it took to get it talking to OBS), it also works for damn near anything else thanks to its ability to do hotkeys,Highly, highly recommended as an all-purpose tool for most computer users","positive":1},{"review":"  Like many others who've purchased this before me, I think this is the best thing for streamers since the capture card,0 port that HAS EXTERNAL POWER feeding it, and you'll not need to worry about the short cord","positive":1},{"review":"  I do a lot of editing in FinalCut Pro X,\" Worth looking into if you do any repetitive tasks on your computer","positive":1},{"review":"  If you use Davinci Resolve this is a must, This isn`t just for gamers and I would say if you color grade, video edit, photo edit, etc - this is something that`ll speed up your workflow and make your life easier","positive":1},{"review":"  I am not a Blogger or Pro Gamer - so this is just something I bought for fun,  The images are nice and bright, easy to see in the day time, and as a gadget guy I give it 100%, two thumbs up, or whatever - it is great","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is perfect,  Looking forward to years of using it","positive":1},{"review":"  If you are just starting out streaming, this is not for you, I would love the option for changeable angle adjustment, as I have my Stream Deck a little farther away from me so the text gets warped from the contoured buttons","positive":1},{"review":"  Since the very first day, buttons did not work 100%, and annoyed the hell out of me,","positive":0},{"review":"  My response to Elgato about their product which I am so thankful I bought through Amazon who refunded my money making an exception based on my documented email run around with Elgato 's direct support, Very disappointed in your product, slow and inept support of your product","positive":0},{"review":"  Stream deck is a bunch of keys and you define what they do to make your life easy and streaming a breeze, In that case, you just need the sign in for the streaming service","positive":0},{"review":"  I have maybe only used this product but a week since buying it this last Black Friday Sale Time before it failed and showed only white icons, Great product and great service but super annoying that I need to go through this","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this device for one reason - to have folder shortcuts, Good product but some poor software functionality","positive":0},{"review":"  At first this thing was a godsend, There's no excuse for this","positive":0},{"review":"  Love the product, Yay","positive":0},{"review":"  I love this for streaming, It takes me 20 to 30 minutes before starting my stream almost everytime to get my buttons back to doing what they're supposed to instead of giving me an error symbol","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a very neat concept but i can't do any special overlay or anything when steaming straight to YouTube, in order to do any of the fun stuff, it shows I have to stream to OBS then download my stream and upload it to my youtube channel making a lot more steps and taking more time","positive":0},{"review":"  This is an almost great product,  If I used it a lot I'd expect my fingers to get tired","positive":0},{"review":"  Even with two monitors, when you're playing a game, interacting with chat, and running a half dozen applications, having to tab around to take care of a task is inconvenient and distracting, I'm glad I bought it, the quality of life improvement has been tremendous","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this primarily to use while playing an online game where I can control several other characters, I can't wait to discover other uses for it in my daily gaming and application use","positive":1},{"review":"  Easily one of the best investments you can make if you truly care about live streaming, Well worth the investment for streamers","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is versatile and extensive with just the built in features, throw in the knowledge of how to script in autohotkey or another program, and you get an infinitely more useful tool,However if you have the itch to take it further and create more uses for it using scripting, your possibilities are endless with this piece of gear","positive":1},{"review":"  I'll admit, I got this thing as a bit of a toy, For the price I think it is an innovative little tool","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is fantastic for a power user,If you're a nut about control and customization, don't think twice about this product","positive":1},{"review":"  WOW,  But simple hot keys are good enough for me to love this device","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is great, hard to believe it's the price it is, in many ways it makes itself far more useful than more expensive equipment,  I wish I was as happy with every purchase and found it as useful as I did this","positive":1},{"review":"  STREAM DECK is  a command center for a computer, Sure you can, just not tomorrow","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my husband as a father's day gift, he is a content creator on several platforms and he LOVES this thing and so does his viewers fans, The packaging was nice, and we haven't had to call tech support","positive":1},{"review":"  Alright, 2 stars says \"i dont like it\" and 1 star says \"i hate it\", Hope this helps you guys and pardon any of my spelling errors","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked fine for about 6 months, Software is always the bane of these sorts of hardware products, and this one is no exception","positive":0},{"review":"  Mine appears to have a line of dead white pixels running through the bottom row, Gonna return it","positive":0},{"review":"  The seller sent me a defective device that was broken upon arrival, Just a giant waste of my money and time","positive":0},{"review":"  Useless garbage, Doesn't even say anything about Instagram","positive":0},{"review":"  After installing the program I there were a few streaming and gaming apps preset,  I havn't even tried this in Windows, but it better be more versatile than on Mac, unless all these reviews are fake","positive":0},{"review":"  Edit: Glitchy mess,This hardware is great, not just for streaming, but there are other uses you can use it for, including editing images in Photoshop (shortcuts to commonly used actions, etc), video editing, and more","positive":0},{"review":"  I really like the Elgato Stream Deck,  So, besides that annoyance, this is a helpful device","positive":0},{"review":"  Got a replacement since the top left button bugs out, and I certainly don't want to pay $150 dollars for something that's defective, I would suggest waiting for this to go on sale","positive":0},{"review":"  Cool product but I have not been able to get the F keys to work with the software, Everything else works as stated","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price, it's not a bad laptop, Would definitely recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop for my son, Its

This replaced an 11 year-old HP Vista windows, It was an easy set-up, it's light weight, So far I like it no complaints, but you be the judge, not bad for the $$ Windows 365, pre-installed for 1 year that's a win win alone ","positive":1},{"review":"  Good product for it's price, I decided to return it but not because of the computer quality, instead for the screen has not the resolution I was

chipset is really what got me, along with the multi-form capability (traditional, tablet - which it's too heavy to hold comfortable - and hybrid) but I would rather have picked something else, especially knowing that as a tablet, it's too heavy and as a traditional keyboard screen the keyboard just isn't great","positive":0},{"review":"  First of all, I will address the keyboard, So wait 10

keyboards so a couple of days of touch-typing i never looked back","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice build quality, good amount of RAM and memory,  But this is a computer I use for non-work

gotten the Gtx 1650|256 SSD|Ryzen 5 3550H Version I gotta say It's a very good price to performances considering it's a laptop that's not breaking the bank too much, A couple of things I dislike is the storage it's only 256gb that's not gonna cut, most likely you're gonna have to buy an HDD or another SSD and also the mousepad isn't that great but it works and also the speakers aren't that amazing so don't expect great audio lastly the battery life isn't that great don't expect to gaming for more than 2-3 hours","positive":1},{"review":"  GTX 1650,The thing that bothers me the most

point","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall this is an excellent entry level gaming laptop, I'm not sure if it is the surface or drivers, but it lags and is sometimes totally unresponsive","positive":1},{"review":"  Prior to this computer I had an ASUS gaming laptop that was 3 times the price of this one,DR - Great laptop for the price, a few little tweaks by ASUS would

turbo, on silence mode the computer save some battery but it gets praty slow eaven to navigate on the internet, on the other 2 it perform better, also for gaming u have to be conected to the power if not your game will go at 10 fps, Also other thing i hate is the brighnes of the screen is very poor and the speaker are the worst i have seen on a laptop they are located on the sides and since you look at the screan from the center of course it is not loud enough","positive":0},{"review":"  First of all, the 120Hz display makes a world of difference, If you want a solid gaming laptop at an amazing price I cannot recommend anything else- the 120hz screen really is a rarity at this price point","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop is great for gaming, Paying up to $400 more to move to an i7 was just not worth it","positive":1},{"review":"  i did alot of comparisons of laptops before i ordered the asus fx505dt and it did not disapoint, it is an awsome laptop and the only downfall is

because it is a mid-range gaming laptop and can play most DX11 - DX 12 games with ease on moderate settings, Overall excellent laptop for anyone and I recommend it fully","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this to replace a Surface Pro 3 with something that could do more gaming, had a conventional form factor and fit my budget and it does well, Most of what I play, though, is stuff like The Sims 4, Cities Skyline, Battletech and Planet Coaster where even low-mid discrete graphics, a not-crap CPU and plenty of storage is more than enough for even high settings","positive":1},{"review":"  Just Buy it, you cant beat the price build quality performance,  If this doesn't fix the issue","positive":1},{"review":"  In short, a Great laptop for the time when it was released if you can get this laptop on sale for like 500-600 bucks BUY IT, This Laptop is far better than a standard laptop that only has integrated graphics","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an amazing entry level gaming laptop, Other than those, this is a great value for the money that won't break the bank","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this because I wanted a laptop with a lighted keyboard, I don't know why the settings keep changing and it doesn't happen on my old laptop","positive":0},{"review":"  I like this laptop a lot for playing games, including on high graphics settings, I do not recommend this

gaming","positive":1},{"review":"  Played Outer Worlds on Ultra Quality without a problem,screen was fine still runs perfect","positive":1},{"review":"  So my gf's laptop was beginning to fail on

was because of overheating, but not it just happens at random","positive":0},{"review":"  Pros:-Good looking laptop-Nice display-Plastic shell but tough,Keyboard is nice to type on","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm not a hardcore gamer, so as long as it runs games smoothly, I'm usually satisfied, Again, concerning","positive":0},{"review":"  The Laptop worked alright for

Chrome device fan, Long wait but as I look through the store none of the apps seem particularly appealing","positive":1},{"review":"  I've always been a fan of Windows but increasingly I've become disillusioned with Windows lack of privacy, vulnerability and incessant security theater surrounding it,GREAT Chromebook, if not the best Sub-$500+ unit in the world","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my first Chrome Book and I am very satisfied so far,Not being paid for this review as sometimes others are ","positive":1},{"review":"  I am surprised by how much I love this machine, Great battery

out for another generation of products to hit the market before I replace my second Chromebook that is hanging in there","positive":0},{"review":"  A few months after my wife had purchased an R 13 we were so happy with it that I purchased another for my own use, As it is a year of operation for a device like this is disappointing and Acer should be ashamed for not covering this defect","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm shocked at the software issues specific to this Acer R13, Less often, maybe once per week lately, the top title bar does the same thing","positive":0},{"review":"  I had the Acer14 Chromebook which only lasted about a year and a half and now I am on track for the same longevity with this one,","positive":0},{"review":"  I might have received a lemon, Completely unusable","positive":0},{"review":"  On the surface this seems like a great device, but it`s not,5 hours of multiple deserts, hard power cycles, chats with IT and

more out of it, Will be returning this one","positive":0},{"review":"  Shockingly good, It was incredibly annoying at first, but the good battery life makes up for it since I just charge it an hour or two on a stable surface while I'm not using it and it goes for hours of video watching and document writing with no cord","positive":1},{"review":"  Using it to write this review, I have stopped using my 4 year old macbook pro in favor of this computer","positive":1},{"review":"  Before getting this, I had a Toshiba Windows 10 machine that was heavy, had a short battery life, was falling apart, and

ipad mini since it no longer received updates, I wouldn't use this as my primary computer but great at being a mobile complement to my PC","positive":1},{"review":"  One of the most noticeable features of the the Acer R13 is the build quality, however, with all things being considered -price, build quality, features, and appearance- the Acer R13 just might offer the best deal for the dollar","positive":1},{"review":"  i like it, i will probably keep this chromebook until the next wave of chromebooks roll out in 2018 and then assess the situation to see if an upgrade is worth it","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is so,  Too bad Acer didn't use full size SD reader (should be enough room","positive":1},{"review":"  Best Prime Day Deal for 2017,Other Chromebooks are

This chromebook is great,  I would also recommend getting a square trade warranty with accidental damage to protect your investment","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a heavy user of resource hungry

However, since Google's library of extensions and apps is only growing, it's going to remain a good computer for day to day use by the average person","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this product so that I could take it to class as my Mac is on its last legs and does not transport easily, Overall, I find this to be a great piece of technology to have for surfing the Internet or taking notes","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer is great, But over all of your looking for a great laptop I would recommend this one","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a fantastic device for home or

ChromeOS can take some getting used to, this is an excellent purchase if you only use your laptop for easy things like online browsing, documents, etc, Though it's too heavy to use one-handed, this is a relatively light laptop that doesn't give me grief when I carry it in my backpack","positive":1},{"review":"  I usually don't review items, but felt I should review this Chromebook since I can't contact Acer anymore without sending the item back, Spend the extra money on a Samsung","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for use mainly for work tasks when working from home,I'm done, I

home,I had photos to add, but can't seem to figure out how to do so","positive":1},{"review":"  Great laptop awesome from gaming can get over 60 FPS on high settings best laptop for a budget only bummer is it`s only has one ram slot which means no duel channel memory which is fine but could be perfect if they put it in 2020 model, I recommend to undervolt this laptop so you can get more speed

First, I bought this product to use for casual gaming (Blizzard's WOW classic) and looked at the specs and price alone and also saw Lenovo made thinkpad computers too (thinking IBM, Lessons learned: do not buy solely on specs, do not buy the cheapest product, if you see anything about cooling problems move on to the next product, research the company, and go to a local professional (ask for recommendations AND non-recommendations)","positive":0},{"review":"  I am not a gamer, Tech guided me through BIOS update, which did not help","positive":0},{"review":"  The first couple weeks with

buying more","positive":1},{"review":"  PROs:* Cools nicely* Fans are quiet* Extra USB slot (ABSOLUTE NECESSITY)* Looks pretty cool* Can shut off the fans lights with a switch when you don't need

its worth to pay a little extra to get a higher quality item","positive":1},{"review":"  Would like to give this more than 5*,  After several months of being on constantly all the fans still work, they're are still silent, and it still moves lots of air","positive":1},{"review":"  This brand is excellent, More than 2 years, and all three are still running great","positive":1},{"review":"  I have to say that I am actually really impressed with this cooling pad,  To me, this is worth the money you pay for it","positive":1},{"review":"  Product arrived as promised, well packed and in great

laptop (Acer Aspite V Nitro) with GTX 960M i7 processors,I'll update this review if I think of anything else or if anything changes","positive":0},{"review":"  My kingdom for a decent cooling pad,Why on earth nobody can make a solid constructed pad with good airflow which can be maintained is beyond me, but I've now gone through several of the top rated pads on Amazon and they all either have these exact design flaw, do not allow maintenance, or have horrible airflow","positive":0},{"review":"  I probably should have looked around more,  Now I can barely see the blue light when the laptop is on the pad","positive":0},{"review":"  I was really excited for this, but it did not meet my expectations,The fans do a fine job with cooling I guess, and the extra USB in the back is a nice touch, but I am ultimately disappointed","positive":0},{"review":"  For videos related to the lack of strength in the air flow, you can check other comments (there are very good videos showing that particular issue), But it just didn't work for me, and I'm not sure it will perform any better for anyone that will be putting some load on his her laptop","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought Havit

cooling pad is terrible for providing support, If you have a large laptop or have vents on the bottom don`t buy this","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted to give this 5 stars because it does keep my laptop cool, but there were other factors that came into play, However, I am a little concerned about the USB ports since they power the pad","positive":0},{"review":"  One has to assume that laptop manufacturers design their products for adequate cooling,  So, I'm happy with this product and hope it adds life to my laptop's life","positive":1},{"review":"  Alright\u201a so I'm an owner of an HP Pavilion dv6 (if anyone is wondering),Works well\u201a just be careful with it","positive":1},{"review":"  For many months I had issues with my laptop overheating to the extent I would switch it off just to let it cool down before I could use it again, I cannot recommend this product enough","positive":1},{"review":"  Within the past year I noticed that my 5 year old 15 inch Dell XPS laptop was producing an excessive amount of heat, especially after I needed to install a new motherboard,I'm very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the HAVIT HV-F2056 to anyone who is looking for a high quality, rightly priced cooling pad","positive":1},{"review":"  This Laptop Cooler has fixed my heating problems on my 17 inch HP laptop, I would buy it again and highly recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  I wasn't honestly expecting much by way of a cooling pad, having had bad experiences in the past, Definitely recommended","positive":1},{"review":"  This works perfectly,3 in Mac book but it can be used for a 17 in laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  Works just as stated, ): Overall great product and will purchase again if something happens to this one","positive":1},{"review":"  This cooling base is just what I needed, I'm a very happy camper","positive":1},{"review":"  Great price, surprisingly good product,  Wish I had bought this years ago","positive":1},{"review":"  I wish I got one that you could change the RPMs of and that wasn't a glowing blue (no you can't turn it off unless you turn off the fan),Would love recommendations for a different one","positive":0},{"review":"  I was having issues with my 17\" gaming laptop thermal throttling,I'm going to take it apart and install real computer fans and see if that helps my cooling, otherwise I would return it","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this in 2015 for my Dell XPS L501x,I still have overheating issues with my laptop that need to be addressed, so despite owning one of these cooling pads, I'm still shopping for something more effective","positive":0},{"review":"  I use my laptop every day,  I am coming online today to try to find one that will last longer than a couple months","positive":0},{"review":"  I used this for my gaming laptop for about a year, I am not an angsty teenager","positive":0},{"review":"  All these glowing reviews and here i sit disappointed,  I have had this for a few months now and  find it to be more hassle then it is worth,  and my last complaint my laptop slides around on it it's not horrible but it is enough to get annoying and the fans vibrates it does not make any noise it's just a vibration you can feel in the keyboard ","positive":0},{"review":"  The unit itself seems well made but it has one huge flaw-the 3 fans are configured wrong for my HP laptop,  Definitely would not recommend","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this cooling pad for my ASUS Rog Strix, and the first negative I noticed was the placement of the fans, I realize that this pad may work for others, but it just wasn't a good fit for me","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm not sure why this product got such high ratings, but I also never owned a cooling pad before so I have nothing to compare to, My other gripe about this is the rubber feet towards the front are terrible, they've already started falling off and don't have a lot of grip (on glass anyway)","positive":0},{"review":"  Note: in my original review of this product, I gave it a full 5 stars,I'll update this as time goes on because I don't know about the reliability of this unit yet","positive":0},{"review":"  The HAVIT HV-F2056 works well with my ASUS fx502vm laptop, When my friends or family need cooling solutions for their laptops, i will recommend HAVIT","positive":1},{"review":"  Ordered this because I play a game on my laptop that caused it to get really hot and then the laptop would start to stutter, I thought about opening it up and seeing if I could disconnect the wires going to the lights but then I don't want to take a chance of messing the entire thing up and having to buy another one","positive":1},{"review":"This is a wonderful product,  Another great benefit of this product","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop cooling fan was great gift for my kid, he really loved the glowing blue,  When the device is turned off the pass through USB port still functions","positive":1},{"review":"  Until two years ago, I'd never owned a laptop ( I own a notebook) and so never had a need for a cooler,All in all, an excellent  product","positive":1},{"review":"  It works good, the only complaint I would have is that the air doesn't blow up on the side of my laptop, where the heat is coming from,  It also no longer smells now that it keeps that section cool","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for the sole purpose of cooling my Razer Blade laptop while gaming,  I am very satisfied and will definitely buy product again when needed","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a neat device, Overall, this pad is structurally pretty strong and very light and the fans are very quiet","positive":1},{"review":"  I rely heavily on reliable Laptop Cooling Pads in order to keep my laptop working without overheating, Highly Recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this cooling pad for one of my PCs in May 2017,  Thank you, Havit","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a beautiful laptop stand, I wish I could write a better review,And yet, I now have to replace it because I can't handle the noise","positive":0},{"review":"  A lot of people complain about the blue LED lights, On the upside, this cooler is very comfortable to use on your lap, giving a nice buffer zone that keeps your legs from getting too hot","positive":0},{"review":"  Well, You will have to experience that for yourself to determine","positive":0},{"review":"  The fans spin, but there is no airflow,  I do not recommend this pad at all","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this because of the great reviews but after almost an year of using this just to give it a good try, I realize how USELESS and weak this fan is, Breaks easily","positive":0},{"review":"  Im currently using this product for keeping my laptop temps down during heavy ArcGIS CAD projects, i use a desktop for gaming so im not too sure how itd handle this laptop on keeping it cool on how much more the video games with overclock the GPU, but honestly I got it on a flash deal and im not really impressed, i used to have an ancient targus cooling pad so i figured it was time to get the new best thing, It weighs only a pound an a half but you can tell why, the plastic seems very flimsy, almost like if it dropped on its side of fell from off the counter it would crack and break","positive":0},{"review":"  This is basically worthless as a cooling fan for any electronics, The blue led's are pretty so there's that I suppose","positive":0},{"review":"  I don`t know how anyone could give this worthless fan a positive review,  Don`t waste your money on this defective worthless product","positive":0},{"review":"  PROS:-affordable-does affect temperature somewhat-cool blue light-noise level is acceptable,SUMMARY: I think this thing is still useful on top of blankets and carpets, but unless you have a machine prone to overheating and or push your gear to max load regularly, a passive cooler would probably do the job for most people","positive":0},{"review":"  This would probably work really well , or if u use your computer on the floor, next to the outlet---Hooray, Never again","positive":0},{"review":"  I would say my knowledge of computers is slightly above average, but not a lot,  You can also go into the BIOS at boot-up to disable it","positive":1},{"review":"  just got this brand new laptop the other day and I'll tell you what, I definitely feel like I got my money's worth out of this baby,I will update my review if anything changes, but as of right now, this is a great laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  I haven't tested this machine to its fullest as yet but, honestly, I thought it was going to be an ugly machine with great specs, So nice","positive":1},{"review":"  Just recieved today have been playing for over an hour and already love everything about it, It runs so smooth and I love the rgb keyboard","positive":1},{"review":"  So I will start this review by making the obvious comparison so that anyone can understand why money doesn't always equal value, Not more and not less","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this to replace a 6-year old Asus ROG laptop, and at about the same price,Overall I would say this Laptop is well worth the money - may not be the top of the line (whatever that means) but I don't think you could go wrong with buying this one","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely wonderful I bought 3 of these me my husband and our son , User friendly","positive":1},{"review":"  first things first: this DOES come with a 1TB HDD along with the 512GB SSD, i messaged customer service because at first i thought it wasn't included with my laptop or that they had forgotten to install it, but they responded super fast and it turns out you just need to format the disk in disk manager, my only thoughts is maybe some line of foam can be added to the box for extra protection, but my box was luckily undamaged","positive":1},{"review":"  With it's 6 core 12 thread CPU, 16gb of ram, and GTX 1650 (slightly better than a 1060 I think, Would be 5 if it weren't for the battery life","positive":1},{"review":"  As a Gamer, I purchase the ACER laptop, which comes with the latest i7 9th gen intel processor and graphic card,  so far the

by Asurion, they are covering the faulty laptop in full","positive":0},{"review":"  First, the laptop was shipped in a box without any extra protection and when opened I could hear broken pieces inside,I threw away my money on this beauty","positive":0},{"review":"  there is an irritant noise from the fans, Remember, this is a hexa core machine, this needs to be taken care of right away","positive":0},{"review":"  having problems with backward compatiable software, touch pad does not like my fingers,","positive":0},{"review":"  Update: Moved this to 3 stars because it has started to black screen, Very disappointing because I like this laptop","positive":0},{"review":"  The battery only lasted one year and when I ordered the same battery model number, the connector was different and the replacement wouldn't fit,","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0We have just received this laptop but when we started there's no display, To think shipping it back will cost us valuable money","positive":0},{"review":"  I've been using this laptop now for four months or so, Just keep it plugged in and you'll have a good time","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this

after giving it a few weeks, There are other products available that are more expensive but quite frankly, I would rahter spend more money abd not have to waste 30 mins just attempting to figure out

picture represents a sturdy laptop stand\u2014 but it is flimsy plastic, Not sure what for","positive":0},{"review":"  UPDATE: After a couple of days of use, it does hold my laptop in an eye-friendly

heavy HD Envy 17 inch laptop, I expect to have many more years of service from it","positive":1},{"review":"  This is awesome, As long as you don't have any kids running past it","positive":1},{"review":"  I like the flexibility to adjust the stand to a multitude of different heights but it seems cheaply made,  It's a small annoyance and not enough for me to return it","positive":0},{"review":"  The stand was exactly what I was looking for, Now it's nothing but a pile of e-waste","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm only keeping it because of the USB fans, I wish you could simply lift them up all together and use a locker to make them stay in place instead of adjusting each joint separately","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a great idea, and I liked it because it helped my wonky body be more comfortable,  We could replace the fans but it just isn't worth the trouble","positive":0},{"review":"  It serves its purpose, I did find once I had my laptop at eye level though it made it unable to type on the keyboard so then I had to buy a bluetooth keyboard so I wouldn't be in an awkward position and wear out my arms and hands","positive":0},{"review":"  I am so sorry I wasted money on this, Don't buy this thing (unless you like Rubix cube puzzles","positive":0},{"review":"  It's been over a month that I purchased it and for the first time, wanted to use the fan to cool off the notebook, only to find out that the fan needs some sort of charger to work, Total waste of $40","positive":0},{"review":"  The tray is sturdy but it's a lot smaller than I expected, working it into the position you want is frustrating trying to follow the diagrams colors because they put no colors on the legs, I prefer my bigger plastic one I bought years ago at Bed, Bath and Beyond, I still have it but the fan or the light doesn't work anymore but I still may go back to it","positive":0},{"review":"  You will not be able to easily or quickly adjust the height and angle in the fly, It's really challenging to get both sides even so it will stand sturdily","positive":0},{"review":"  Its a great item to have for using it on your bed, over your lap, or on a table desk,NOT Recommended if you have a small space with no table and expect this to work fine by its self","positive":0},{"review":"  My cat, Charlie, just waits patiently for me to sit down in my chair and hops up in my lap practically before my butt hits the chair, Mine assembled looks like the product picture","positive":1},{"review":"  This has been a lifesaver, I did not give it a full 5 stars because it is abbot if a hassle to adjust from one setting to the other, however at this price point you are not going to find much better","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm enjoying my laptop stand enormously, \u00dcber handy","positive":1},{"review":"  So, first I will get the bad out of the way, Those willing to live with the few caveats I pointed out should really consider this product","positive":1},{"review":"  I am in LOVE with this product,I teach online, so my camera should always be stable, and it is stable enough that nobody notices when I type","positive":1},{"review":"  It took me a while Playing Around with the buttons to figure out the legs worked separately and you had to push the button all the way IN to move the leg and hold it in to move it where you want and let go and move and hear it click in place, However, for most the ways I want to use it, I find it Very Valuable and  it folds flat when not in use","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this so that I can work standing at my desk, Overall, I'm pleased with it, as a basic adjustable laptop stand","positive":1},{"review":"  I regularly use this to turn my desk (or really any table) into a standing desk with my 15\" laptop and bluetooth mouse (I'm 5' 9\"), I put little marks on the adjustable joints at settings I like to make adjusting quicker since getting the 2 sides even can take a couple tries if you don't pay close attention to the angles","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great solution for someone looking for a standing desk with their laptop, If you use a laptop as your primary work computer and are looking for a standard desk - this is an excellent solution","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent overall product, Glad I purchased it","positive":1},{"review":"  I used this on my desk to raise up my laptop,  it slides out of reach too","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this product,ie=UTF8&psc=1","positive":0},{"review":"  After a few weeks of use, I want to like this product, but cannot wholeheartedly recommend it,I will keep using this tray for now, but would prefer to work with a standing desk and lap desk combination instead","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my husband who is bedridden and thought it would be great for him to use his laptop, buy only if you have a newer light laptop and or tablet","positive":0},{"review":"  The push button adjustments are not the greatest if you are one who works in different space where adjusting is required often, Good add on","positive":0},{"review":"  I was excited to get this stand, Luckily I saw it slipping and was able to catch it before it fell on the floor","positive":0},{"review":"  Cheaply made product that arrived broken, These stands are all the same and there is no need to spend any more on a product that is exactly the same - cheap plastic","positive":0},{"review":"  Unexpectedly sturdy, it also has fans that I don't need so extra money spent on that,","positive":0},{"review":"  I was highly disappointed in the product, It`s difficult to get it set up to where I needed it and if I needed to readjust I had to take my laptop off of it because the stand would get cockeyed since you can really only move one part at a time","positive":0},{"review":"  Loved this stand, perfect for what I needed, until the button stuck inside when I tried to adjust,","positive":0},{"review":"  The need to stay at home due to a broken leg, and the need to keep it elevated meant that I could no longer make proper use of my office table, which got me searching for those breakfast in bed trays to use for my laptop, I've mitigated this by taping a single ply of cotton wrap under it, but that's admittedly kind of tacky","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this to put on my desk and be able to stand while I work, It's great","positive":1},{"review":"  this product is a steal for the price, great if you work long hours at a computer","positive":1},{"review":"  I rarely review products but decided to write one for this stand, If I had read reviews that were honest and pointed out the right things I would not had spent more than 5 minutes on picking it","positive":1},{"review":"  Works great, Even if the actual table is tilted(if you prefer your keyboard tilted toward you), the mouse surface still needs to be parallel to the floor","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is a million times better and more versatile than I could have ever imagined, Can you tell how much I love it","positive":1},{"review":"  I am extremely satisfied with this laptop stand, that I own since July 2017,It's still a 5 out of 5 starts after 3 years of use","positive":1},{"review":"  I absolutely adore this purchase, never knew how much I needed it until I had it, Also the surface is textured but not terribly grippy so I live in constant fear that my computer may slide right off and I am planning to add some rubberized material for added grip","positive":1},{"review":"  Admittedly, we use ours exclusively as a laptop stand and it works beautifully, seems like a big increase in a short amount of time, but for the price, its still worth it, knowing what I'm getting for my investment","positive":1},{"review":"  i read in another review someone not expecting a lot out of this product for one reason or another, a must purchase for any laptop user","positive":1},{"review":"  Good stand, provides stable support for a laptop up to 17 inch screen, I recommend, instead, one of the styles with provision for mounting the mousepad on one of the legs","positive":0},{"review":"  I really like this stand, I must now decide whether to buy a new stand or deal with the RMA shipping process","positive":0},{"review":"  I couldn`t easily utilize this stand anywhere, Wish I would have saved the money","positive":0},{"review":"  Received my stand this morning,  There wasn't any damage to the shipping box or the packing box, so it must have been broken before or during the packing","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted something that i could carry with me to the airport and on

area, I should be able to pick up at least all of the clear channel stations, (50 Kw) which number at least a dozen or more, but this model only picked up 2 stations, (barely) and that's not a functioning AM band if that's the limitation of an \"emergency\" radio,If an emergency radio can't provide the function of reception during an emergency, then it fails to be what it claims to be used

use and adjust","positive":1},{"review":"  I work from home full-time (even before the pandemic) so I am always looking for ways to upgrade my work space, I wish it was a little more solid but overall this is a completely affordable and useful alternative to an actual standing desk","positive":1},{"review":"  The product seems well made and for most people I am sure the product is fine,Maybe using it for a tablet is beyond the scope of the product, but building in an unnecessary limitation doesn't make sense to me as it limits its applicability","positive":0},{"review":"  I had the table for 6 days, and it broke, Frustrating inconsistencies and terrible business practices","positive":0},{"review":"  First of all, this is a good product,I will give it some more  time and see whether this suits me or not","positive":0},{"review":"  ugly, badly made and wobbly,","positive":0},{"review":"  Pros: adjustable tray tilt and leg height, I would recommend taking the laptop off before adjusting the tilt, or holding the tray firmly as you make adjustments","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price point, this lap desk seems well made and has some very nice features, We wanted to like it, but sent it back","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted it specifically to use on my sofa, If you just want to use it on the floor or on a bed - it would be fine","positive":0},{"review":"  This adjustable laptop table offered a disappointing first impression, I haven't experienced other laptop tables but I would guess you can find something better elsewhere","positive":0},{"review":"  so is it just me or is this super wobbly,  I cannot use a product that moves every time i try to  type","positive":0},{"review":"  I have never written a review on Amazon, Will be returning","positive":0},{"review":"  I am so very satisfied with my Avantree adjustable laptop bed tray,  It also foldsflat for storage","positive":1},{"review":"  Exactly as pictured, Still have the same opinion","positive":1},{"review":"  Once I knew I`d be working at home for the foreseeable future, I needed a standing desk of some kind, Regardless, it`s great for my needs","positive":1},{"review":"  The table in itself is very helpful for posture and to avoid neck strain when working from home for long hours,  if it was between $30-45, I would say money well spent, but the price is just outrageous for such cheap material","positive":1},{"review":"  Avantree Quality Adj,NOTE:  I did NOT receive any discount or benefit for my review","positive":1},{"review":"  Works just as described,","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this table to use mostly for coloring, so that I wouldn't have to sit at a table,I really cannot think of a thing that I do not like about this handy little table","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this item to use in a flexible sit stand desk set up, Sitting on a couch or floor, this is a handy and convenient work surface for causal use","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great little table,(Dell XPS 13 displayed on table for size reference","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this as a standing desk in my 4th grade classroom,no complaint from kids or their teacher (especially when I could get a sale price considering they were purchased out of pocket)","positive":1},{"review":"  The plastic thing that keeps laptop from sliding off at an angle is too high and is uncomfortable if you need to type, My son can use it to hold tablet and write on or eat on so we are keeping it","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price, its below average with cheap plastic all over the fixes, Otherwise its just an okay product","positive":0},{"review":"  It works well as a collapsible and portable tabletop standing-desk surface for a laptop, my use, Glad I bought it","positive":0},{"review":"  Despite the wonderful features of adjustable legs and desktop slope, I have to wonder why the heck the manufacturers made it impossible to adapt this table for the use of left handed mousers,  And they could also offer it to new buyers with the interchangeable option","positive":0},{"review":"  I've used it work on my 15\" Surface Book 2 while sitting on the floor, Folding it is easy enough and I always raise it to its maximum extension","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this specifically for my 17\" laptop so that I finally had one that had room to have the laptop and the mouse,  Other than that it is a nice piece","positive":0},{"review":"  Not sturdy and very wobbly, It would be perfect then","positive":0},{"review":"  First,Innacurate , it was not what we expected poor materials , wood, Also, if you are going to act as if u were a customer make it believable For U \"Common on\" oKey Your video Obstructs this Universe","positive":0},{"review":"  I am disappointed the legs are not more adjustable for height ( as in adjust it to s lower position),5-2 inches too high","positive":0},{"review":"  Got 2 of these tables mainly as \"homework\" tables for my toddlers to use while sitting on the floor,I think the table is great when it works but I am disappointed that a small 1-year old would be able to break the leg off so easily","positive":0},{"review":"  Overview:This machine does a pretty good job living up to its advertised capabilities,  The laptop provides HDMI and a mini-DPort so it's not lacking in output options, but still","positive":1},{"review":"  Laptop performs great, Maybe consider an RMA before you trash talk the machine","positive":1},{"review":"  I almost cancelled my ordered when realizing the only reviews were all from Vine reviewers, At this time this was a great and enjoyable purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  This is hands down the best laptop, or even desktop, I have ever owned, 1660ti is just the best for laptops balancing performance and battery","positive":1},{"review":"  After owning the last Helios 300 (GTX 1060) and selling it last year I was ready to be done with the Predator laptops,  Yeah it's expensive and I wasn't too thrilled about shelling out for another Predator after all the problems with the first one, but I am glad I got this and I know you'll be too","positive":1},{"review":"  The Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 laptop with the Intel i7-9750h & nVidia 1660 Ti is a great performer,5*7 (inches)So far I'm very happy with the laptop, it has excellent performance, very nice expandability, is comfortable to use and looks really good","positive":1},{"review":"  So I'll start with the fact that this laptop came with undervolted cpu which I found kinda strange, Played PUBG on ultra settings, max cpu temps were ~80\u00b0C and gpu max temps were 70\u00b0C (max fans on both)","positive":1},{"review":"  The Q&A led me to believe this was a 144hz display, but it's 60hz, Will update this review if anything goes wrong but so far so good","positive":1},{"review":"  All I have to say with this laptop is just wow, (Other brands, please take notes)","positive":1},{"review":"  I did a ton of research before landing on this laptop, I also bought a 4-year warranty to hang onto this as long as possible without any worries","positive":1},{"review":"  UPDATE: July 16, 2019, In the future, I'm buying Asus, HP, Dell or anyone else but Acer","positive":0},{"review":"  What I like:The hinge feels amazingThe overall performanceThe portability, it is light and the metal behind the screen helps with the feel of it, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this obnoxiously loud laptop but I might have to put it in another room and stream from it","positive":0},{"review":"  Acer is the only brand of Laptop I've ever used and I've loved all of them EXCEPT THIS ONE,Lucky to get two stars","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0The acer helios 300 2019 model one of the worst gaming laptop, Worst laptop ever, will never ever ordered here in amazon forever","positive":0},{"review":"  Vents blowing air directly to the charging cable on the left and to your mouse hand on he

esta historia de terror pronto se solucione","positive":0},{"review":"  Product did not work out of the box,  I decided not to waste time and just send it back to amazon and not stray from Lenovo again","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0I have spent around 6 months looking at computers and trying to find something good for me that will last at least 3 years, after I did my research and looked at every laptop on the market that is around 1000$ that is good for the money, then this Helios 300 came out recently  although I was about to get the older one,My problem is that I am outside the US, this laptop was brought to me from the US to Turkey by a friend of mine, and I would really love to replace this device and get something different","positive":0},{"review":"  My expectations were completely wrong, The GPU gives me temps around the 85 celcius mark","positive":0},{"review":"  Simply put, this thing is great especially at the $928 black Friday 2019 price I paid, Upgrading is very simple, just need a philips screwdriver, and there's many videos online of how to open this laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  What I like most about the Predator laptop is the wide, clear and bright screen which is not only great for gaming, but for any visuals such as art, photo editing, watching videos, etc,Comes with Window 10 preloaded and with Cortana personal assistant","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop is a beast, I highly recommend this beast of a machine","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this laptop for about 24 hours now and am seriously impressed with it,2 slot","positive":1},{"review":"  Bricked,Update: I did eventually get a new one and it has been working well","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop is amazing, I can't describe it in few words this will take a lot of time to and I want to write a short review as much as I can, thank you all and I hope for you a wonderful life","positive":1},{"review":"  A few weeks ago I got my first gaming laptop that had an i7 8750 & GTX 1060 3gb card for $799,Only cons I can really thing of is the low starting storage, the slight bloatware you get with it and there's a bit of backlight bleed but whatever, so far it was a great buy for me","positive":1},{"review":"  If you're looking for a laptop that is a drop-in replacement for a desktop, then this is probably not your device, Corrected","positive":1},{"review":"  All good and fine but I am disappointed with the white visible shades of light on a black image,","positive":1},{"review":"  Looking for a laptop that can handle my Rift S games,  I ended up getting a Legon Y540 laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  At first, I enjoyed this laptop a lot, Their customer support stinks and will drag out the issue for weeks, no matter how many times you express your frustration on how it is impeding your progress in school","positive":0},{"review":"  Received laptop on Thursday, specs are great and it was playing games on high settings at 70+ FPS,Edit: after finding more complaints of the same issue I`ve opted to return it instead of rolling the dice and getting another bricked unit","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this laptop on Amazon Prime Day and was pretty stoked on it, I didn't want to believe the bad reviews people were leaving on this laptop, but now I'm one of them","positive":0},{"review":"  I really do like the sleekness of it but I am also disappointed disappointed that I spent a grand and a half to have a battery that lasts maybe a hour or two when in portable mode I know it`s good for the price and has all the specs you would want but it feels like another desktop I can`t use it without having it plugged in and it definitely doesn`t last no 6 hours it last 2 if I`m lucky really disappointed like how can you make a laptop so good and overlook that people want to be able to game portably which I haven`t tryed gaming but I thought oh 6 hours would be good I`m only using fl studio it dies in a hour of usage really upset writing this review because I use to have a Acer laptop back in the day and I was so excited to get this brand new one only to find out it dies with minimal usage even just being on browser kills it another thing to add is that the storage the storage should come with 1tb like I rather have slower boot times then to have to have a external hard drive it`s just frustrating because I love the specs and rgb lighting but the battery and storage make this laptop so annoying,  I really do like the sleekness of it but I am also disappointed

getting a different machine from an Acer","positive":0},{"review":"  Updated Feb 27,Best to all","positive":0},{"review":"  Edit: So much for initial honeymoon period,  You'd be surprised even with card games how much a high refresh rate monitor can improve the overall feel of gameplay","positive":0},{"review":"  The hardware seems to be pretty well designed and it plays various games pretty well, I just tried replacing the internal disk to see if that would fix it, but the system doesn't see that disk, either, so I'm thinking that it wasn't (just) the disk that burned out, but probably a chip or cable running to the disk","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop is NOISY sure, I'm cool with that, the whirr of the fans as it turns into a jet engine on full afterburners,Pretty lost and pretty pissed off","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laptop as a well needed upgrade,my 5 year old Lenovo remains my go to system","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laptop to replace an

(the blue trimmed one is 2019), was the best option (esp, when It was on sale for $999$),Will update of anything changes","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop's performace is unbelieveable, If someone has some thoughts about this situation feel free to leave a comment, it would really help me out","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this laptop for almost 3 weeks and have been putting it through its paces with general use, games, watching streaming videos, etc,Despite some faults with this laptop, overall, I like this laptop a lot","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently got a job that requires me to travel a lot, Buy this thing before Acer realizes that they could sell it for more","positive":1},{"review":"  The new model Helios 300 is a vast improvement over its predecessor, which was a steaming pile of hot garbage, For the same price point, nothing else compares","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to replace an MSI Wokstation laptop, Everything just works","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely love my Acer Predator Helios 300, If you are looking for a great gaming laptop look no more, this is it","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this laptop for my wife and she absolutely loves it,  I wouldn't run a game on \"ultra\" while trying to stream but if you want to game and stream at the same time, this will perform that fairly well","positive":1},{"review":"  I, personally have 2 very main problems with this laptop,I am willing to keep the laptop but I don't know about buying it again in the future","positive":1},{"review":"  I received the laptop brand new unopened, I will update my experience later","positive":0},{"review":"  I received what appears to be a defective unit, If the repair center keeps temporarily fixing the unit, then the cycle just continues, and I lose time, money, and productivity","positive":0},{"review":"  I was looking to upgrade my son's Dell Inspiron laptop that lacked a gaming quality graphics card, We returned this to Amazon and purchased an MSI Stealth G65 laptop locally (for a few hundred more than this Acer) and absolutely love it","positive":0},{"review":"  Skip to bottom for Pro Con Summary,*Fan is LOUD when gaming","positive":0},{"review":"  UPDATE 2:Working with Diane at Acer Corporate Customer Care Dept, I'm debating returning the thing and am frustrated that I spent the money","positive":0},{"review":"  Updated 05 2020:I'm docking two stars (previously 4 stars) because the bezel of the screen has cracked on both sides near the bottom, These are things I can generally look past but they bother me enough to keep them in the back of my mind when buying another laptop","positive":0},{"review":"  Was happy about the specs and price, Buyer Beware","positive":0},{"review":"  Other laptops of the same specs as the Acer Predator sell for almost $100-$200 more,5 hours unplugged)-Factory software and driver issues with power and audio (sound stuttering, wifi network adapter disconnecting)-Fans get very loud even during light or idle usage, system temp reaches above permissible at 81-85\u00b0C-Acer customer service is lukewarm to unresponsive-Still requires you to remove the entire bottom of the laptop to access ports for upgrading, whereas competitors' models have readily accessible panels-Plastic

has been amazing, especially for the price, One minor issue I had is when I tried to update the GTX 1660 ti driver I had to do it through the device manager, for some reason when I downloaded it straight from Nvidia it said it wasn`t compatible","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this gaming laptop,- The laptop ships with a lot of bloatware installed like Norton and other things, it`s not great uninstalling those, but I got most of it uninstalled and then it was fine","positive":1},{"review":"  There is no better laptop on the market right now in this price range, You just can't display only to the external monitor if you want to use a USB-connected controller, you gotta do extend desktop","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm a week into owning this thing and it's an absolute monster, Just YouTube it, don't take it to an ACER center","positive":1},{"review":"  I researched several laptops looking for one to mainly do business and edit photos and videos, but also with enough power to play some high level games at times, I would recommend this laptop, very happy with my purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this laptop for about a month now and I really love it, Little guy can take a hit of heat but that`s why we get a cooling fan right","positive":1},{"review":"  For $1000 USD, this is the best bang for buck, It still has enough power to stay on if you unplug it and adjust the setup, which is good enough","positive":1},{"review":"  Bricked after updating windows and wouldn't recognize 2nd drive, If you want to play upcoming games like Cyberpunk 2077 or have a relatively future proof machine for 1080 gaming this is an easy buy","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is a beast for the price, I bought it during the prime day sale,Definitely satisfied with my purchase no buyers remorse here","positive":1},{"review":"  Only been using this for a few days but I can easily say this is one of the best computers I`ve ever had, If you have the

getting so hot it smelt like plastic was burning, I could barely touch the keyboard in some areas, I'm Afraid to play anymore games on it, The screen has a LOT of light bleed, more than ive seen on other IPS Panels, Will be returning this, My first and last Acer i will buy","positive":0},{"review":"  Have already had the blue screen of death come up about 4 times in 5 days since using the computer,Probably why I will not purchase high dollar items from Amazon anymore","positive":0},{"review":"  Changed from 5 Stars to 1 Star, I got an HP Omen same exact specs for $999 and it's faster then all the laptops I've previously owned Acer Predator 300 and Dell G7 7790 RTX2060","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this to replace my 3 year old gaming laptop that was due for an upgrade,I'm trying to determine if it's worth a refund at this point","positive":0},{"review":"  A few serious issues with this laptop,  I would definitely not recommend this laptop to anyone","positive":0},{"review":"  The system runs INCREDIBLY hot, I'd never recommend this unless its at a huge discount, though","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this laptop back in June July of 2019 when it was on sale,  A laptop shouldn't have such catastrophic problems this soon","positive":0},{"review":"  Purchased this laptop for a SANS 660 Course, I had to travel to attend, You get what you pay for","positive":0},{"review":"  It's known that these Acer models have backlight bleeding but some are much worse than others, The specs and the build quality itself are amazing for the Helios - but the screen seems to have some quality issues","positive":0},{"review":"  Holy smokes this stuff is legit,","positive":1},{"review":"  INSANE FOCUS, I did notice if you take it for like 15 days straight it starts to lose some of it's potency but I figured out that if you just take a couple breaks in between, you'll be fine","positive":1},{"review":"  Let me preface my opinion by telling you that I had a brain injury 5 years ago, Hopefully they offer more flavors in the future","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm a brain vitamin junky & very hard to impress, The Genius Consciousness product blew me away, I will be ordering infinitely","positive":1},{"review":"  I have used lots of nootropics to clear brain fog and focus better, By no means am I close to having dementia but if it works for people that have dementia, it will definitely work for me","positive":1},{"review":"  Had to put this to the test and it delivered, I ended up passing my CPA exam and this product definitely gets a lot of credit for helping me do so","positive":1},{"review":"  Being a single mom & trying to go to school has never been easy and I don't think anyone ever would mistake it as such, I also feel my level of attention increased so much that I'm about to get more done in much shorter periods of time","positive":1},{"review":"  I love so many things about consciousness I really don't even know where to begin but I guess for starters I'll say the taste, Not a bad price compared to my $3 per day energy drinks","positive":1},{"review":"  LOADED, Very good product","positive":1},{"review":"  Biohacking in general has taken my cognitive abilities to another level, This carries me throughout the day and when I was just taking it by itself, I felt it throughout until the end of the work day but my latest secret now","positive":1},{"review":"  This stuff works pretty well, This makes sense as I don't expect anything to stay in my system forever but after reading the reviews, I hoped it would last longer","positive":0},{"review":"  My husband and I both tried this for two days and neither of us felt any different,  Seems like maybe these reviews are rigged","positive":0},{"review":"  This product caused damage to my liver and I was hospitalized from it, It's dangerous, hasn't been FDA approved and can wreak havoc on your body","positive":0},{"review":"  Like many other people, I read the 5 star reviews for this product and was very anxious to receive it,  At least I am able to return it for a refund, or I would really be upset","positive":0},{"review":"  Omg, It`s going back and I`d urge nobody to ever ever consider this","positive":0},{"review":"  Good flavor,  Bad customer service","positive":0},{"review":"  I tired the Genius Consciousness formula, It noticed the best results within a few hours of taking it, then it seems to wear off gradually after that","positive":0},{"review":"  What you get here is a cup of powder redirected from that search from a prescription drug your pilot friend or classmate with ADHD gets, You should probably go on Tor, or ask your friend with ADHD if you need something to actually help you concentrate","positive":0},{"review":"  Did nothing for me,  It may be just me, and I may see if anyone else I know wants to give it a try, but who knows","positive":0},{"review":"  I haven't felt much effect to start with, added to the fact that my stomach is hurting considerably after the taking of these supplements, I have literally thrown my money down the lavatory","positive":0},{"review":"  I got SUCKERED on Opti-MInd with their brilliant marketing lol, After Optimind I was hesistant to ever try nootropics again but I'm happy I did with this stuff","positive":1},{"review":"  It really doesn't get better than this, Getting more sleep, eating properly, exercising etc","positive":1},{"review":"  Consciousness has helped me a lot in my college lectures, If nothing else I definitely benefit from being able to stay awake during lectures","positive":1},{"review":"  Love it, The shot of joy typically comes within 15 minutes of taking this on an empty stomach and lasts well throughout the day with NO crash or jittery feeling","positive":1},{"review":"  I used this to help me before a very difficult strength and speed competition with over 30 obstacles in 3k, I will never be without an ample supply","positive":1},{"review":"  We all know that everyone's body metabolizes and reacts to chemicals differently,It helps me tremendously with focus day to day, which I struggle with  Seriously guys, it's good stuff","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased Genius Consciousness, Also forgot to add there is no comedown, you feel just as good after since your taking nutrients","positive":1},{"review":"  I thought this would be a gimmick but it's actually not so bad, Its not going to 'wire' you but you'll have focus without jitters","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a college student and this product allows me to concentrate for longer periods of time, as well as focus more intently on my school work, I would recommend this to any student as a study aid","positive":1},{"review":"  Before trying Genius Consciousness, I hadn't tried any other nootropic so I can't say how it compares to others, I noticed that there are some darker granules that sink to the bottom of the glass and have a bitter taste so the last sip of the drink wasn't very good, but the rest was pretty refreshing and tasty","positive":1},{"review":"  I found I had more energy, I still would end up drinking a red bull as well","positive":0},{"review":"  Taste wasn`t awful, Just made me badly sick to my stomach all day","positive":0},{"review":"  So as with any supplement, experience varies from person, but nevertheless I can attest this does work, If not, it stands at above coffee or nootropics alone, but not pharma level focus","positive":0},{"review":"  Taking this product does seem to stimulate my mental functioning,  That is too pricy a habit for me","positive":0},{"review":"  It has a lot of ingredients that are thought to work,","positive":0},{"review":"  I haven't noticed a difference,  I didn't get the same affect","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is good to use as long as you`re not expecting a miracle right away like a lot of other reviewers I`ve noticed on here,","positive":0},{"review":"  The reviews sold me on this,i will not be a repeat customer","positive":0},{"review":"  I don't really notice much of a difference on the days I do use it,  Maybe a slight bit of increased focus on the task at hand, but not enough to say it works with confidence","positive":0},{"review":"  So I attempted to contact the company via freegeniusbrand, Will be requesting a refund for all 4 products","positive":0},{"review":"  Hiyaaaaahhhhhhhh, It does it's job though, gets me into a focused, energetic state of mind and another big point is that it tastes great","positive":1},{"review":"  I don't take this too often, not every day, And I can be pretty sure better than caffeine on it's own","positive":1},{"review":"  Okay, so I did not know about the free product in exchange for a review thing until I got my order and it came with a little flyer urging me to make a review for a free bottle (btw when you do the review you get to choose the product you want but this product is not one of them, it is only less expensive products such as Genius Mushrooms, Genius L-Arginine), But with Genius Consciousness my experience is so much improved that I am going to keep buying it (even though it's so damn expensive -- I am in Canada so with the conversion it's really a lot of money)","positive":1},{"review":"  Background, my son was on Adderall and we wanted to take him off of it due to side effects,As of right now, I will continue to purchase because it does seem to work","positive":1},{"review":"  This product has done very well at helping with focus both in class and away from class when studying, Although these are awesome results, and it is an awesome product, I would not recommend if one is trying to use this for a fast- paced situation or high energy one-- keeping in mind it is probably slightly different for each user","positive":1},{"review":"  It works and it works really well,  Until then I`m just going to use gelatin capsules","positive":1},{"review":"  Giving it 4 stars as it does somewhat work, no shakes, no increased heart beat, etc","positive":1},{"review":"  Brainhacking at it's finest, If you only take half servings once a day it will last you 30 days but if like me you take half a serving in the morning and another half in the afternoon it will only last you 15 days","positive":1},{"review":"  This product works great, Aside from that it's a fantastic product","positive":1},{"review":"  No hype, no over-the-top testimonial -this product works, Other than this, I'm sold and will continue to use it","positive":1},{"review":"  This product did not deliver what it says, No focus, had such high hopes based on the reviews and the ingredients and was very disappointed","positive":0},{"review":"  Well it works alright, but I didn't get any more out of it than I get out of caffeine or ginseng, No way","positive":0},{"review":"  Like many others, I was very impressed by all of the stellar 5 star reviews that made this nootropic see,m like a game changer,  In conclusion, this is not the right nootropic for me, nor could I recommend this for others to use","positive":0},{"review":"  Review after 7 days of consistent usage:  I didn`t feel anything, Overall, I`m disappointed that this didn`t work for me, but I am optimistic that I can find another Genius product that will work for me","positive":0},{"review":"  I read all the positive reviews and thought this might actually do something since everyone was saying such good things about it, It literally does nothing","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted to love this but I got very minimal results while using this, I gave it a couple of weeks worth of use to try and get something out of it but not what I was looking for","positive":0},{"review":"  Really loved this stuff at first and noticed a huge burst in my productivity,

body","positive":0},{"review":"  Update 6 3 2019- Ugh, Hoping for the best","positive":0},{"review":"  I have been taking one form or another of some type of nootropic cognitive enhancer off and on

stacking with Genius Joy and using Genius Sleep at night","positive":1},{"review":"  I was interested in this primarily for the short & long-term memory benefits since I'm notoriously forgetful and

love","positive":1},{"review":"  This stuff is magical, I have been using it now for over a month and can say that brain function has definitely improved, My ability to focus was the first noticeably

I don't have much use for supplements that I can't use daily","positive":0},{"review":"  This wasn`t my favorite, There are other, more affordable, options from more honest companies","positive":0},{"review":"  I am a licensed Social Worker, working in the field of mental health for the past 12 years of my life, diagnosing and  given therapy to children and families, On

jam, maybe the 3rd time is the charm or maybe this isn't the laminator for me","positive":0},{"review":"  The Scotch thermal laminator has potential, Based on the quality control and design of the unit I would not recommend this laminator","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm returning it because the rollers are defective - or a roller is defective,  I'd hate to order the same one and end up with the same issue","positive":0},{"review":"  Sadly, I let this unit sit new in the box for over 8 months,everyone said this was the good one but that wasn't my luck","positive":0},{"review":"  ***Update***I posted earlier that the laminator did the auto shut off thing and would not turn on again even after unplugging it for a few days, I just pitched it and bought another from a different company","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this machine on 2nd of August, however, it stayed unused in the box till today,I'm sure it's a one time malfunction and i hope both these companies sell quality products in the future for the sake of companies' rapport and their customers' trust","positive":0},{"review":"  I literally got 3 uses out of this laminator, Won`t repurchase again ESPECIALLY after reading that I was not the only this happened to","positive":0},{"review":"  Admittedly, I bought this product almost 2 years ago but it has sat in the box unopened until today,So I do not

more truthful I find),","positive":1},{"review":"  In the past, we always went to Fedex Business Office to laminate Professional Identity Cards, BMV and Proof of Insurance Cards, etc,  Highly recommend the Scotch Thermal Laminator TL906","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this about 8 months ago and have used about two full packs on laminating sheets with it, For 30-something bucks, this was a great buy","positive":1},{"review":"  Does what it should reliably at a very reasonable price with a safety feature that works, Since I was able to wait, it got easier to get through to the phone and mail the cord back using their online process to get the refund issued","positive":1},{"review":"  This is not my first Scotch laminator and I loved my last ones- in fact they still work after thousands of pages, but the tray broke, so I thought I'd try the fold in tray model, however, I wish it would move the sheets through a bit faster as big jobs can take longer and don't seem to seal any different with the Pro version than with the regular model","positive":1},{"review":"  It would have been nice to have a longer feeding tray so your small pieces on the tray don't slip into each other, I found that it takes about 5 minutes for the laminator to heat up and be ready","positive":1},{"review":"  I have yet to use this with more than one item that needed lamination, so I have no truly tested how well it stay at temp, Perfectly heated and sealed","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this little appliance, I can't believe I waited so long to make this purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  The title says it all: I use this thing constantly, It'll serve you well","positive":1},{"review":"  This was a good laminator and a good value for the price, but

get my money back","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s a fairly simple straightforward machine that is far from perfect but is budget friendly, I`m going to return this and get a different model with less issues","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laminator during my last semester of college as an Education major, I always worried about the reviews that say the machine melts burns, but I did not have that problem","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased in November and did not even open the box until today,  The laminator appears to be easy to use but is useless to me","positive":0},{"review":"  This machine laminates well - the heat is a good level, Too bad it has a terrible design","positive":0},{"review":"  The laminator works ok but has a major design flaw, I get this is an inexpensive unit but this is a pretty huge deal in my opinion","positive":0},{"review":"  So at first I was really excited about this little laminator, So when it works I think its great, but since it only worked once I think there is definitely a major problem with the manufacturing and or quality assurance of this item and not worth the money","positive":0},{"review":"  The anti-jam technology is a crock,  I`ll be looking for another brand","positive":0},{"review":"  I have used Scotch laminators before, but this model is a potential fire hazard, Hoping I have more luck

the back the next time I use it","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this product for work, Beware: it takes a while to get hot","positive":1},{"review":"  This laminator is great - the size is nice, the design is modern and simplistic, and it is not bulky, My son uses it for baseball cards and other odds and ends","positive":1},{"review":"  This laminator is not cheap to be purchasing a new one every time it breaks,  Time to find a new one - AGAIN","positive":0},{"review":"  The product worked well for the few times I used it, I got 5 mil sheets and they would often come out a bit hazy but running them twice as per the instructions usually helped to clear that up most of the time,Can't say I recommend it for just the few jobs you'll get out of it before it desides to make itself obsolete","positive":0},{"review":"  It's decent for the price,5x11 sheet, they need to be spaced pretty far apart otherwise, the heat doesn't completely seal in between the items","positive":0},{"review":"  My laminator worked great until it died only 8 months later, I will not purchase it again due to it`s lifespan","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this product in February of 2019,","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this 2 times, It should be pulled off the shelves and repaired","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this model when my first laminator was

Highly recommended","positive":1},{"review":"  with the current hurricane systems and possibilities being ever stronger this year getting a crank radio was at the top of our to do list, This one is super light weight and very convenient to carry and pack or keep in the emergency basket without taking up much room at all","positive":1},{"review":"  Small and exquisite, multifunctional, beautiful in appearance, very practical and beautiful in price, The packaging is also very strong and reliable, and the people need such good products","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a very nice emergency radio with lots of features, As an added plus it comes with an SOS button that is really loud","positive":1},{"review":"  After  seeing the grass planted in Mingming laboratory, I was surprised to start with it, Of course, I hope that I will never encounter an emergency","positive":1},{"review":"  The light is bright, and the speaker is loud and clear, We tried all three, and it charges well","positive":1},{"review":"  From my research, the vast majority of these \"all-in-one\" radio charger flashlight emergency crank solar alkaline-option crank radios appear to have the same basic chinese made guts, but with different cases, buttons, and logos,This does the job","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this radio to add to my \"hurricane\" kit here in Texas and I must say that it's much better than I expected it to be, It's also fairly compact - see attached picture in my hand for an idea of it's size","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0Everyone should have one of these in their car, Everything seems water tight, but I have not tested it in the water","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this just Incase for an upcoming earthquake in California,  Everything works well and the speaker is pretty loud","positive":1},{"review":"  To begin I hardly ever write reviews, I may even, buy another","positive":1},{"review":"  This Emergency Solar Hand Crank Radio is portable and very handy during power outages, Definitely a great item to add to survival backpack, keep in car, and at home for emergencies","positive":1},{"review":"  Powered by external batteries or internal Li, this radio also is solar rechargeable and features not only an adjustable standing lamp but also a spotlight, Well worth the money","positive":1},{"review":"  First of all, I leave in the Caribbean, so having a portable radio is super important for emergencies during hurricane season because we do get a lot of power outages, Would recommend and would buy more as gift to family that live here on the island as well","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s fine as an emergency radio, But if you need a just in case emergency radio that has a power crank, solar battery or regular store bought battery options this will do the trick","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall a good product for the price, Will help if we flood to get attention as it`s loud enough","positive":1},{"review":"  Everything works perfectly and it's such a cool little device, I'm not sure if mine had a defect or something, but it seems like a weird flaw in the product since USB ports are standardized","positive":0},{"review":"  tired charging it with the solar panel and the hand crank, We did not return the item due to throwing out the boxes it came in originally","positive":0},{"review":"  Way too too small, I returned immediately,  I want one that's larger","positive":0},{"review":"  Very disappointed, I bought three as Xmas gifts, I am ver disappointing","positive":0},{"review":"  I decided to use the radio to be

that","positive":0},{"review":"  We live about 30 miles from a major city, so perhaps people closer to a city and radio stations do better,  Otherwise be prepared for Weather and AM to be unavailable","positive":0},{"review":"  Charged first time and then won`t charge again,","positive":0},{"review":"  After using this occasionally as an outdoor radio for a few months, the built in lithium ion battery had trouble holding a charge,  It's nice to have the emergency radio band and a spare flashlight","positive":0},{"review":"  This was so tiny and felt like a toy, DO NOT BUY","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this radio primarily for the cell phone charging feature, which my old emergency radio lacked, Overall, very please with it","positive":1},{"review":"  Pretty good for the price, I would recommend this as a backup or buy more than one","positive":1},{"review":"  Just arrived, Will test the battery life and how charged is my cell phone soon stay tuned","positive":1},{"review":"  I only have about a days experience of using this radio and so far, I am pleased with it, Subbing that material out for metal or a more corrosion resistant material would make this perfect","positive":1},{"review":"  All things considered, I really like this little device, I wish I had this when my power got knocked out by a storm a few weeks ago","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this product to add to my emergency kit, and I love how versatile this is, Also I would use the hand crank as a last resort as that might seem it could break if used very often and quickly","positive":1},{"review":"  Luckily we have not encountered an emergency situation where this radio flashlight has been essential but that has not stopped us from enjoying it,  We love it","positive":1},{"review":"  It was smaller than I expected it to be, but for the emergency kit, it's the perfect size, I tested everything out again to make sure before putting it in the emergency kit, and all is good and dandy","positive":1},{"review":"  I just love how compact it is, and how many ways of charging it has, It is really useful","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased as hurricane emergency radio,Dislikes: charging cord is 6cm long, if raising the solar panel to adjust for sunlight a white flashlight comes on","positive":1},{"review":"  The hand crank handle snapped off fairly quickly, I purchased with intent for regular daily use and was disappointed","positive":0},{"review":"  So at first glance this was a great unit, it worked decently upon arrival, however within 2 weeks of use (using the radio once a week and testing the battery life with radio and lights) it performed decently, until I tried plugging my phone in and it wouldn`t charge at all, and even though the instructions say it won`t operate on am when charging it actually wont operate anything other than lights when you have a phone or headlamp plugged in to recharge,","positive":0},{"review":"  This was smaller than I thought and the knobs were small so I returned it,  This was smaller than I thought and the knobs were small so I returned

short while, I returned the emergency radio","positive":0},{"review":"  Total JUNK & can't return now, I didn't try the solar panel","positive":0},{"review":"  It's a pretty good product, but one of the main reasons I bought it was that it was said to charge phones, Maybe it's because I have a relatively old iPhone - a 5E","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the quality of sound I got from radio frequencies (even though I have not yet used it in the country), it's easy to use and I like that it has both a flashlight and a flexible reading light, It has only truly worked so far with AAA batteries","positive":0},{"review":"  This is good to have as an alternative powered radio, but as a NOAA alert radio , If you're looking for an early warning weather radio, this is not it","positive":0},{"review":"  This was much smaller than the one I have,  I don't yet know about the battery life but it has a crank handle for that so I am sure that will be fine","positive":0},{"review":"  Got one of these for my household last winter, then got another for my father-in-law, Strongly recommend this","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio is medium in size and is perfect for my first aid kit, It is best to over-prepare rather than under-prepare","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been wanting to get this product as I consider it essential in the area where I live, I was searching And saw several different options until I came across this one, Good purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  I opened the box and turned it on and nothing, Great value","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this radio for bug out bag,Bonus features like flashlight, reading light and usb port work every well","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this to add to our emergency supply kit, Very happy with this purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  We bought this for emergencies after we had a bad power outage, Quality is very good and would recommend this for anyone camping or for emergency supply","positive":1},{"review":"  In addition to the many features listed in the product description, real aerobic and forearm workouts are provided when utilizing the hand crank to charge the included Li-ion battery, Will likely prove invaluable during unanticipated power outages","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed this for those emergency moments when the sirens go off in stormy season when TV is out and I need weather updates,  I put rechargeable batteries in and we'll see how that goes when I actually have to use it","positive":1},{"review":"  With the wicked Hurricane seasons in recent history, I sent these radios to my favorite people,Great for emergencies","positive":1},{"review":"  the only part that worked properly was the siren and the light,","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the size, color, and quality of the materials used to build the radio, I`m returning it to look for another that will meet my needs","positive":0},{"review":"  Radio never worked,  Radio never worked","positive":0},{"review":"  The USB broke before I could use it,  I kept it for that reason","positive":0},{"review":"  I've been charging in the sun for days

properly","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased it because I thought it would automatically come on in inclement weather, But that is not the case, it was returned","positive":0},{"review":"  Well don`t expect a large size item,","positive":0},{"review":"  The radio doesn`t play at all, the instructions are gibberish so it`s impossible to figure out what`s wrong, and there`s no contact information for the manufacturer, Shame on the merchant for selling this crap","positive":0},{"review":"  Great sound for a little radio, Too bad the USB port isn't glued in better  - can no longer charge the internal battery after less than a year of very little use","positive":0},{"review":"  do not know how it works at a time when I need it I will know more this summer when they turn off the power again  off my power for days and have lived here for over 40 years and have not seen any fires even close but there are power lines close and I guess they are not maintained well and might break

emergency multifunction radio","positive":1},{"review":"  This is smaller than I expected, but honestly that's a good thing, I like that there are multiple charging options to provide power TO the

device","positive":1},{"review":"  I don't know how dependable this is for the long haul but have checked it out and everything works great,  Hopefully, we will never need to find out how well it performs with long term day to day use but I believe it will work well if needed","positive":1},{"review":"  I am pleased with the emergency solar radio, Overall, for the price, I am glad that I purchased this device","positive":1},{"review":"  I tried this radio out as soon as I got it, to make sure it worked, since it is going in our emergency go bag,  We were able to pick up the emergency stations, and the reading light was plenty bright","positive":1},{"review":"  My sister love this radio, I'm looking to buy a 3rd one soon","positive":1},{"review":"  I was surprised at the small size, but it's solid and feels well constructed,  Worth the money","positive":1},{"review":"  The metal collar which receives the USB into the side of this unit to recharge it has somehow come loose and falling into the device, Amazon won`t give me the option to return it as I am out of the return window, but I paid nearly $50 for this thing so it`s pretty frustrating","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this radio at the beginning of May, used it a couple of times then to test it, and then tried it again yesterday, only to find out the radio no longer works, Don't buy this piece of junk","positive":0},{"review":"  The crank is really small sho your hand will slip a lot,","positive":0},{"review":"  The usb charging port got pushed inside the radio the 1st time that I tried to

this for my daughter for 5th grade, as they have online homework assignments,  I make so many purchases on Amazon, and never return anything, but this is just beyond the pale","positive":0},{"review":"  I was ordering this computer to replace an Acer Chrome, that I was no longer able to connect to my wireless printer and touchscreen no longer working,","positive":0},{"review":"  It was awesome until the screen cracked for no reason, It was fine in the morning when I went to use it later the same evening the screen was completely shattered","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a good value for a first computer bought for my daughter 4th grade the touch screen some times acts up but it could be the user, The only bad thing was the two screws that hold the hinges together for the screen both fell out and were lost, tried to communicate with the seller, but they wanted pictures of the problem and I needed to get it fixed fast

the good deal ","positive":1},{"review":"  Great lightweight option for my daughter`s remote learning experience, With easy set-up, and long-lasting battery, this was a great affordable quality purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  Great purchase,  Versatile, lightweight, portable, clean and clear","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop itself is perfect for papers or internet, Windows S is lame and I recommend installing Linux Manjaro or Lubuntu because they're lightweight and fast: you have to boot into bios with f2, then set bios password so you can disable secure boot","positive":1},{"review":"  This review is solely based off of the assumption that someone would be using this as a secondary device, with a bigger laptop or PC at home,  Definitely a great value","positive":1},{"review":"  The first thing I noticed about this little laptop is that the case is made of metal, not plastic like most inexpensive laptops these days, This laptop is meant to be used as a mobile device since the power cord is very short, but it works fine on just the battery and the the charge lasts a long time","positive":1},{"review":"  First off, I've been using cooling pads for my laptops for close to 15 years, So if you're wondering if this is the cooling pad for you, it's worked wonderfully for me and it keeps my laptop cooled down while gaming and I believe it will do the same for you","positive":1},{"review":"  This arrived yesterday with my new gaming system and it's just what I was looking for,If you're looking for a pad to cool your gaming system then this is the one you want","positive":1},{"review":"  I've got a 17\" Alienware M17x that is about 5 years old and it runs so hot that within minutes you can't keep it on your lap, and it regularly shuts down due to overheating,The ONLY nit I have to pick is that a couple of the little rubber pads that are stuck on the bottom of the pad have fallen off and I've lost them, But that is minor compared to the fact that this cooling pad actually cools my previously non-coolable laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  I have my 17 inch gaming laptop on this thing all the time, Highly recommend to anybody that has a laptop, especially a gaming laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  This is by far the best cooling pad I have ever used for my Laptops, Buy one today you will not be sorry","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing works awesome, and tge cool LED lights on fan makes it more better","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this item on August 28, 2017,  I use this almost daily 3-5 days a week while at work","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this for some time and here's the deal, I put a little piece of felt there and it's fine, but this should have been thought of at the time of construction","positive":1},{"review":"  When I ordered this product it was because my laptop was operating at 93 degrees Celsius when I was gaming, even on a low graphics game,  Works very well, I will definitely recommend this product to anyone","positive":1},{"review":"  Five fans with speed control, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT","positive":1},{"review":"  Edited 2019-02-27: A little over 6 months in now and 2 of the fans' bearings are wearing out and making nasty noises,Fans on the bottom edge are kind of superfluous as they are not near any intake on most current models of laptop","positive":0},{"review":"  I have an old ASUS laptop that overheats often, sometimes multiple times a day, Still worth it to squeeze more life out of a laptop well beyond its life expectancy","positive":0},{"review":"  At first glance, it is very cheap, of course, I'd appreciate a replacement, as I assume it is only a problem with the specific one I purchased, but for now I can only offer this product a 1 star","positive":0},{"review":"  lets start with how its not the best for heat , the design looks nice , but the fans dont cut it ,how did i come up with this you may ask,the stand itself is constructed well , sturdy light weight, it fit into my bags back slot perfectly so i can take it on the gobut for fan performance its an F as it literally adds more heat into the system when its on","positive":0},{"review":"  Item arrive with outer package dry but with an overbearing chemical scent, Doesn't deserve even a 1 star but you cannot post without it","positive":0},{"review":"  It's a shame because when it worked it did a great job of cooling my laptop,  Thank God I didn't throw it away","positive":0},{"review":"  I received this today and sent it back for return today,Please don't buy this","positive":0},{"review":"  Updated 2 star review from April 16th 2018I originally ordered two of these last year on September 4th, The one time I used it on a higher setting the air from the fans started making me cold","positive":0},{"review":"  On the highest setting there is virtually no noise but only because the fan speeds are so slow you can barely feel any air coming out of it,At least my laptop is off the desk and on something vented now but I wouldn't buy this for gaming","positive":0},{"review":"  Base Temp was 100 F with the cooler while gaming in ultra with cool boost on and cooler and laptop fans set to max peak temp 195 to 187,Also one of the two usb ports on the side have to be used to power the cooler so you gain nothing","positive":0},{"review":"  Excellent,Cooled down my \"Easy Bake Oven,\" oops, I mean my old laptop that has a broken fan, by 59\u00b0F, from 220F (auto shutdown temp) to 169\u00b0F","positive":1},{"review":"  Simply stated, this is not a \"pad, It is always a good idea to keep your gear running cooler, and for the price, you get a simple product that does a good job of this","positive":1},{"review":"  I live in Texas and we get hot here, Glad I made this purchase and did so based on many product reviews of which this was my choice of them all","positive":1},{"review":"  Just as advertised, excellent quality, met my expectations, Would buy in again","positive":1},{"review":"  Works great, still 5 stars","positive":1},{"review":"  Beforecoretemp-isa-0000Adapter: ISA adapterPhysical id 0:  +58,0\u00b0C, crit = +100","positive":1},{"review":"  I absolutely love everything about this cooling pad, Highly recommend this one for really anyone that owns a laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  This pad does do a great job getting small amounts of cool air up under the laptop,Pros-Quiet-Portable-Plug n play-Works-Looks coolCons-LEDs always on (it`s honestly not bad but it`d be nice to be able to turn them off or change colors)-Blows air but not very hard, more to help vent the system than cool it, but it still works very well","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0Built quality: The build quality is surprisingly good compared to more expensive ones, I actually bought one from Best Buy for $44,Note: Please excuse the children playing in the background","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this product, it's a perfect fit for my 15, This is not my first HAVIT product, and will not be my last","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this pad right after FFXIV: Shadowbringers dropped, so admittedly I was using it a lot,The only reason I didn't deduct more stars is because it did the job and did it quietly before the switch broke","positive":0},{"review":"  I originally bought this for my PS4 PRO (for the loud fan issue everyone seems to be having) and I`ll be honest I`m pretty disappointed in its performance especially considering it had so many great reviews, I`m sure there`s better products out there","positive":0},{"review":"  No change in cpu or gpu temp with any use of the laptop (light  moderate  heavy), I reduced stars because of shotty construction and not performing the task we purchased it for (cooling the computer past what the laptop is capable of)","positive":0},{"review":"  Literally just received from USPS 5 minutes ago, Please, do not make the same mistake I did","positive":0},{"review":"  First and foremost - the description is very misleading, however, they do not really produce enough cool air to really cool down your laptop - they lower the temp by maybe 2 degrees - so they do function - minimally","positive":0},{"review":"  Did a decent job at cooling during video editing gaming on my 17, I guess I have to buy from a different brand now","positive":0},{"review":"  I m a gamer who owns a gaming laptop (MSI 7RF Raider - GTX 1070 8GB) apart from a PC, There are some other cooling pads which have less fans but do its job to the mark","positive":0},{"review":"  May be better for ultrabooks, but it barely cooled my gaming laptop, I got a 2 fan version from another brand that outputs more air","positive":0},{"review":"  Is there a vender out there that sells laptop coolers where the fans do not constantly fail after six months use, Why do they put these cheap-ass fans into these laptop coolers","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the design of the pad with the two USB ports and the adjustable fan speed,I just received my cooling pad yesterday so I will keep updating my review with time","positive":0},{"review":"  About two years ago I finally got wise about my Macbook Pro warming my lap and purchased my first cooling pad,  It's a well-built, solid cooling pad that I think will last you for many years to come","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this thing just about daily for gaming and I really love it, I have not regretted purchasing it at all","positive":1},{"review":"  This pad works fairly well,2 hub, with 3 or 4 additional ports to expand it even more","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this in 2018 for my Dell Alienware 15 R3 because if anyone is familiar with those laptops they get extremely hot quickly along with sounding like a Boeing taking off for flight, Where they thought ahead here was rather than have you lose an entire USB port to power the cooling pad they added a second USB port on the cooling pad itself which actually has worked perfectly for me in terms of any device working as it would if it were directly connected to the laptop itself","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this fan, It was rated as one of the best in an affordable price range","positive":1},{"review":"  For the longest time I was worried that there was something seriously wrong with my laptop because the lag I got when playing online games was intense,  It's perfect for cooling and it fits my 17-inch laptop perfectly","positive":1},{"review":"  Matches my HP Omen, I do not expect this thing to have a long life-span with all the moving parts and plastic design","positive":1},{"review":"  Did drop CPU and GPU temps down about 30-40 degrees Fahrenheit each during max performance, Protect your investment, which this does an adequate job of","positive":1},{"review":"  Was looking for a fan to cool down an old laptop this does seem to be fairly powerful however it is pretty bulky and takes up a lot of desk space so if you`re in a tight confinement I don`t know if this is the right direction you want to go,that could be Beneficial or a drawback depending on how you look at it","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased two of these for laptops in my household,Overall, it I am happy with the purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  It has been stationary for a year so it hasn't been banned around except for extremely slight moving around on desk, Pretty much garbage and wouldn't buy again","positive":0},{"review":"  After reading the reviews on this cooling pad I had High Hopes :( The fans do not move a lot of air at all, I will keep it but had to order another fan to connect to the cooling port on my laptop","positive":0},{"review":"  Even with the pad raised to encourage air flow, the fans are not strong enough to aid in cooling a laptop, I returned this for a full refund","positive":0},{"review":"  It's VERY quiet, I guess something is better than nothing, but I'll be looking for another cooling pad to compare","positive":0},{"review":"  Product is okay, Lights and fans are one so you can't shut off lights without shutting off fans also","positive":0},{"review":"  My laptop would continually overheat to the point that it would shut it self off during long gaming times,  Next go round I may opt for a more expensive unit with higher grade fans","positive":0},{"review":"  the cooling fan worked great but lasted a mere 4 months,lesson learned","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall it's a low-quality product it works well for a month but then the fans eventually stop spinning, the only thing that lasts long is the LED lights inside the product probably because they cant turn on fully off of the USB, speaking of the USB the passthrough port doesn't provide enough power to pass anything through, Overall get a different fan that is less extravagant for working features","positive":0},{"review":"  I give it a 3 star because honestly,2 ssd1x1tb evo 860 ssdGtx 1070 full not max qOh well least maybe I can play in bed without my jewels melting","positive":0},{"review":"  I mostly would say that this is the perfect cooling pad for a gaming laptop,  I don't know who to go to at Havit to find out what the problem is","positive":0},{"review":"  I recently purchased a new gaming laptop at the ripe age of 36, The 5 extra fans can pull in air and also blow into the laptop which *should* help cool it, but if it doesn't what's the worst that can happen","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this in March of 2018 and we love it,0 A Male 90 Degree Right Angle to A Male Left Angled Plug Short Cable, which has made this pad perfect for us","positive":1},{"review":"  Update: Seller contacted me and immediately offered to send out a replacement and allowed me to keep the broken one, Looks cool but apparently the manufacturer didn`t do well","positive":1},{"review":"  At max fan speed I was able to get use to the noise level and for me it has blurred into the background noise I am use to, but even then I am able to listen to my laptops speakers well enough, So if anything the Red LED isn't too bright that it bothers me but its not bright enough to even help or be noticed so at this point I'd say don't buy it if you wanted some ambient  red light, but its an okay nominal noise laptop pad cooling fan","positive":1},{"review":"  My Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series laptop was emitting a little too much heat and causing a discoloration to the natural wood dining table where I use the computer most,","positive":1},{"review":"  If you're gonna use this to seriously try to cool your computer, not sure how much benefits if will have, While it lacks in power it makes up in nice build, quietness, and weight","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0My first one worked just fine until about 6 months after I bought it, when one of the fans started making a horrible grinding noise,","positive":1},{"review":"  I initially bought this to replace a different cooling pad with fans, I liked it so much that when I got my new gaming laptop I bought one for it as well","positive":1},{"review":"  It does exactly what I wanted it to do,3\" laptop so that is a huge plus","positive":1},{"review":"  so far it keeps my mac book pro 2014 cool,","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, when I can actually get the unit to power on, it DOES seem to lower the temperature of the laptop, I like the idea, but I'll probably end up getting a different brand eventually","positive":0},{"review":"  My fault for not realizing the upright option is limited to maybe an inch to inch and and half,  The USB ports are not snugly staying in place so if you move slightly you hear the disconnect and reconnection (a lot)","positive":0},{"review":"  For having so may great reviews, I expected this thing to move air like a champ, and alas, it just moves are like a kinda,  I rate C+ for gaming, B for general use","positive":0},{"review":"  I didnt want to leave only 2 stars because it works for what I need it to do, Very quiet, and it keeps my laptop cool while playing games","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this fan a few months ago for a 17, Will likely have to purchase another one that is a little higher quality","positive":0},{"review":"  UPDATE: I want to be clear that after contacting Havit, they sent me a new unit with no hassle, however, there is an inherent design flaw in the design of the unit (the replacement has now lasted 2 years but has the same issue with the short in the on off switch) for anyone who uses a laptop IN THEIR LAP, the on off switch will rub against the chair arm and eventually short out,If you don't mind replacing your cooler on an almost yearly basis, this unit is for you","positive":0},{"review":"  This product claims to fit 17 laptops, it doesn`t, I will say it looked pretty good and the usb pass through is nice","positive":0},{"review":"  All 5 fans work like they should, but very underpowered and made very little difference in CPU temp (5\u00b0 Celsius

daughter and decided not to bother, Or if you have new parents in your life, this would make a great gift","positive":1},{"review":"  Note: Although this says I purchased the Rohm, they accidentally sent the Hushh, and I didn't bother sending it back since I had a hard time deciding which one to get in the first place and thought they seemed pretty similar, I've never heard it","positive":1},{"review":"  I've only used it for two nights, but so far I like it a lot, If I'd known you could get a good white noise machine this small, and for $35, I would have gotten one sooner","positive":1},{"review":"  We have an original Marpac Dohm (mechanical fan) white noise sound machine, and 2 of the all-electronic Zohne units, which we love,  It gets a 5 star review though because the unit functions very well","positive":1},{"review":"  So, I like this one because it has a good volume control and the noise it emits isn't in an obvious loop and there isn't anything jarring about it,All in all, despite the cons, I still like it","positive":1},{"review":"  Honest review after trying multiple things to help my son sleep,","positive":1},{"review":"  Unfortunately

legitimate","positive":0},{"review":"  I really liked the idea of this sound machine, Sadly, this will be returned","positive":0},{"review":"  It was great until the past two nights when it shut off at 3:45 AM and woke up us and our baby,  As the product is less than 5 months old I would have expected it to last longer","positive":0},{"review":"  This is nice if you need something loud, I can't

of the night","positive":0},{"review":"  Biggest pile of over priced crap, It's really too bad","positive":0},{"review":"  We bought this to use the ocean sound for our baby as we were sick of

had any bad experiences with Amazon till this product, Love Amazon, but this time is very hard for me","positive":0},{"review":"  Very dissatisfied, based on reviews and descriptions of this product I

when my perfect-sounding fan developed one of those annoying faint clicks, I wasn't able to find a new fan that was both loud enough and without some kind of slight clacking noise that I can't sleep with, It lasts at least 9 hours without recharging","positive":1},{"review":"  March 2020: Juliann, in the yogasleep customer service department, reached out to us and wanted to make things right, We

other product from Marpac, send it to Marpac directly and they will make you happy like I am","positive":1},{"review":"  The original Dohm Marpac sound machine is so incredible, this portable version doesn't provide the same high quality product, But if I come across a better one I will replace this one and give to a friend with a baby","positive":0},{"review":"  this Does not hold a charge for longer than four hours, and won`t turn on  make noise if it`s charging, But I`ve read they`re supposed to be made in the USA and mine says made in China, so maybe that`s why","positive":0},{"review":"  I really wanted to love this, There are plenty of other small sound machines- steer clear of this one","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this Rohm because I'd used my brother's Ohm and really liked

first we really loved this little machine,","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this based on the suggestion of Cara from Taking Cara Babies, So if you're planning on using this for your baby and

paperweight","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm an extremely light sleeper - I can't get through the night without a white noise machine to drown out the ambient noise, I recently used it in Mexico City

to love this, but it's not worth the price for only 4 months of moderate use","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this portable sleep machine to take to my son's daycare,  I need to wait until the battery dies for it to stop and then charge it again which is a pain and makes it impossible to continually use","positive":0},{"review":"  I feel terrible giving a 3 star review because i actually do

this radio so far,  Fortunately haven't needed for a crisis, but anticipate it would do its job","positive":1},{"review":"  I had previously used the FRX2 as a radio and flashlight when camping with

cant help him out","positive":0},{"review":"  Geez Louise, when I click 'reorder' on Amazon, I expect to get the same product again but NO, instead of a 8 inch by 8 inch solar panel it has a 1 inch by 6 inch solar panel, I guess they thought it needed shrinking because it already wasnt doing a sufficient job of solar charging and it's freaking OPPOSITE DAY, and I see that they still claim that I can use it to charge my phone but NOPE they couldn't be bothered to include a charging cord to connect my phone to the radio, I'll have to buy that separately just to find out whether this radio does ANY BETTER at phone charging, the design I bought last time charged my phone up to 50% while taking the radio from a full charge to dead, then the next time the radio went from full charge to dead with the phone battery going up 15%, then the next time the radio went from full charge to dead with the phone battery going up 5%, then the radio never charged my phon again, It had better be a good phone charger, it should have at least one design change that didn't make it worse","positive":0},{"review":"  Works ok but unit is not rugged like the shell design would have you believe, Also, it doesn`t come with an AC charger","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought 2 of these weeks ago, to use as Christmas gifts, Make sure to check your order right away to ensure you got what you

people talk to discover the radio decided to turn itself on","positive":0},{"review":"  The one I ordered I thought had generic rechargeable battery replacements, but the one I received had a custom battery pack, Battery died after a month and will no longer hold a charge","positive":0},{"review":"  Very poor rechargable battery life,Poor sound quality","positive":0},{"review":"  All the - reviews just be haters, BUY THIS RADIO","positive":1},{"review":"  Good unit but no water resistance, in a emergency situation bad weather is too be expected, since this radio has weather features, the fact that it could get wet or rained on and stop working is a little disturbing, i assumed it was weatherproof when i got it,  Other than that great little unit, just dont get it wet","positive":1},{"review":"  This saved me during a recent power outage,  I highly recommend that everyone should have one in their emergency supplies","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a handy item and easy to use, the best feature is the charger it doesn`t take much to increase your battery life in a cell phone or other USB device, I would recommend the larger square one, the Bluetooth

light weight and design is pleasing to look at","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio is great, I feel this will be very helpful if we get a hurricane and I feel more prepared having bought it","positive":1},{"review":"  I have no problem at all with my emergency radio ,(Since writing the above , this emergency radio does have illumination on keys ","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought

end","positive":0},{"review":"  didn't work at all in the emergency, No follow up, no replacement, nothing","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought August 2019 for my hurricane prepKit,  On here looking for

around 10-11 hours of regular use)-keyboard (good travel distance and feels very responsive)-'infinity edge' display (very beautiful)CONS:-when i ordered the device, I thought the 1080p was a non-touch, but it wasn't (poor descriptions for corresponding version of this device)- NOTE THAT THE SSD PORT ONLY SUPPORTS SATA (so if you want to buy 128gb and upgrade the ssd, make sure you have a sata ssd)EXTRA:For those who are comparing this to the razer blade stealth (kaby-lake version), please don't, I have both devices now and the superior build quality and battery life of the xps13 is definitely a smarter choice","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the only laptop I've been using that didn't get returned after a week,5\" and is aesthetically pleasing-the battery can last up to 14

to desktop screen-really light, which is perfect if you'll be traveling around with this laptop-the keyboard feels smooth and really easy to type with-the quality of pictures is fantastic, great for

didn't do anything that even challenged the battery","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this machine to be a simply task manager for basic computer functions, word editing, email, browsing etc,Still, for the cost, simplicity, ease of use, its a great machine","positive":1},{"review":"  For the price, you really can`t beat this product, I guess that`s just the Google platform","positive":1},{"review":"  Great \"laptop\", Overall I love it","positive":1},{"review":"  So fast, so simple, so light, The keyboard is nice (though I would have preferred caps lock instead

great product and I would purchase it again","positive":1},{"review":"  Great case, I also like the additional little pouch on the outside which can hold the chargers, although then everything gets a little tight","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been looking for a case that was durable, waterproof, and wasnt too big for my laptop, all in all, wonderful purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  I got

variety of sizes, so you have the opportunity to find the sleeve that fits your laptop perfectly,  If you need to carry a power adapter in the bag with you, you need to find a bigger sleeve bag, which will no longer fit your laptop like a glove","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered the light grey 13\" sleeve for my 13\" MacBook Air 2020,3 which then of course the 13 would be 'too snug'

Well made but my MacBook Pro 13\" slide around inside, I'm returning it","positive":0},{"review":"  I can`t speak to the water resistance, but I have a brand new Apple MacBook Air and it slipped out of my hand when I was putting by backpack in the car, and even inside of a back pack, this sleeve couldn`t protect the computer and it got a dent in the corner, I`ve been busy with family emergency, but felt I needed to warn other computer owners","positive":0},{"review":"  I was really looking forward to this product to protect my computer, but when I opened the package, I could immediately see

MacBook Air and the sleeve wasn`t even wide enough to slide my computer in, The sizing is off","positive":0},{"review":"  I just received this sleeve today, and while it`s nice it`s not what`s advertised, This might be great for older models,  but it`s just ok bukly for the newer MacBooks, and most importantly it`s not vertical","positive":0},{"review":"  I am nos sure if I received a used

it","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop sleeve to use for my new MacBook Pro 13in, Thanks for reading my review","positive":1},{"review":"  Initial impressions upon receipt is it has a nice soft lining, I have found just being aware and pulling out on the corner of the sleeve as you are pulling out on the zipper to ensure that protective strip is between the zipper and the laptop and not pushed down to the sides of the laptop and it will just fall into place and your laptop shouldn't be exposed to the back of the zipper at all","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing fits my MacBook Pro, my charging cord, my magic mouse, and my adapters,I'm very satisfied with this case","positive":1},{"review":"  I really love this little case, Don't go spilling things on it, but if you

not","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought the 13, There's a bit of padding in the bag to prevent dents and whatnot, and there's a small pocket on the outside if you want to carry something like your charge or extra cables in it","positive":1},{"review":"  The case is a bit loose with a 16\" MacBook Pro, but it is snug enough that I will keep it and use it,I would probably recommend this case to someone who generally looks after their things","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a review of the 15\" sleeve,24 inches (L x W x H)I bought this thinking the extra spacing in the size would be perfect but I ended being at the physical limits","positive":1},{"review":"  Received this sleeve today and am really happy with it, And it`s looks very professional","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this in July and the zipper already broke, Would not reccomend","positive":0},{"review":"  My MacBook Pro, zipped tightly in this case, fell approximately four feet to the ground, and when I removed it from the case, I discovered that the corner of the laptop is now dented and chipped (on both the top and the bottom),  Have communicated with Mosiso customer service, and they seem slow to respond and unhelpful so far","positive":0},{"review":"  The bag looks exactly like the photos, This is sufficient to keep your laptop from getting dusty or to add additional padding if your backpack doesn't have enough in its laptop compartment but I wouldn't trust this as the primary mode of protection for an expensive laptop","positive":0},{"review":"  I chose the light pink color and immediately regretted it, Good luck keeping it clean","positive":0},{"review":"  I`m sure this product would be a great source of protection from scratches and very stylish for traveling but I wouldn`t know because mine never left the box, Not sure what when on in the manufacturing warehouse, but I am very disappointed to say the least","positive":0},{"review":"  I dropped my Macbook Pro *in the sleeve* from maybe one and a half feet and the LEDs on one side of the screen all died, I'd only recommend this if you don't need much protection for your computer but just something thin so it's not rubbing against your other items","positive":0},{"review":"  I just purchased one of these for my brand new 16 inch MacBook, I would return but I'm past my return window, so I've ordered a different case to protect my MBP better","positive":0},{"review":"  Great for my large Dell computer NOT great for my 13\" MacBook Pro, Is prices inexpensively for a reason","positive":0},{"review":"  Maybe I didn`t read into it enough but the product title is misleading saying it`s for 13 inch Mac book air, Wish I got something else","positive":0},{"review":"  I like a little bit of room in a laptop sleeve in case I want to slide some papers or something extra inside, but this one is definitely not sized to fit my new 2018 13\" Macbook AIr, It's padded but not too bulky, but it's just not a good fit","positive":0},{"review":"  The overall quality is pretty good, The only thing is that the product itself smells a bit, although the smell is not very strong","positive":1},{"review":"  Update:I purchased the dark green one and it feels like great quality,I deducted one star because this is not the correct color","positive":1},{"review":"  It seems odd to me that I would spend well over a thousand dollars on a new MacBook Pro and then scrimp on the accessories,I bought this mainly because there wasn't a great selection of sleeves for the not-super-new 13\" MacBook Pro (USB-C), and it will work just fine, but if I had a choice I would have invested an extra 20 bucks or so for one that feels more matched to the quality of my MacBook","positive":1},{"review":"  This sleeve fits my Lenovo ThinkPad T460 very well, If you have a ThinkPad T460 - this sleeve is a no-brainer","positive":1},{"review":"  I like that I could choose from so many colors, If I were to change anything, I would ask that the outside pocket be just a bit looser to also accommodate a mouse","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall I`m very happy with this laptop case for my MacBook Pro, Otherwise, I am satisfied with it","positive":1},{"review":"  I picked up this case to protect my new work laptop, and over the last 8 months it's held up very well (I haven't spilled anything on it, so I can't attest to how waterproof it is, When it comes time to replace this case, I'm going to see if this brand manufacturer makes one that's a little bigger","positive":1},{"review":"  As noted by another reviewer, I checked inside dimensions and reluctantly ordered the 15 for my 16 MacBook Pro 2019 model,  Zippers seem durable","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop sleeve is light and it fits my laptop perfectly,I also purchased another sleeve for traveling that has sturdier corners and additional padding","positive":1},{"review":"  So i have the new mac book pro 13\" and i wanted to keep it protected, I like the 13\" i just wish it was a big wider to fit the charger not longer","positive":1},{"review":"  It looks like they put a lot of effort into making a case that protects your laptop,  You definitely look less professional","positive":0},{"review":"  It looks to be a well made laptop sleeve but the stated internal dimensions for the 14-15\" sleeve are actually smaller than described, It slightly protrudes from the top of the sleeve and the sides are pretty snug","positive":0},{"review":"  too tight fitting, had to return it, however , they refunded my money quickly","positive":0},{"review":"  This is about 3 inches too wide and 3 inches too tall for a 2020 MacBook Pro 13 inch, Maybe I was sent one for the 16inch I am not sure but I am not too happy with this because the originals packaging was a thing g plastic bag that rips when trying to unstick the sealant","positive":0},{"review":"  I was looking for a laptop cover that looked sleek, will provide a soft yet firm protection,  So the picture is nothing like what I got","positive":0},{"review":"  Not sure how well it protects against bumps or falling but for as compact as it is, ite worth the trade, Other wise it is a great case","positive":0},{"review":"  If you are looking for a case that will properly fit your laptop in order to protect it, BEWARE, This case is also very bulky","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0The package came to me looking alright, no damges or dents on the box it came in, but when i opened the contents, the screen protector had two noticeable wrinkles, the top part of the cover had some scratches and the case that the laptop goes in has A LOT of visible wrinkles as if it was folded several times, I am very unsatisfied with this","positive":0},{"review":"  The sleeve itself is just fine, and that size is too big","positive":0},{"review":"  Baaaaaaarely fit my 15 Mac book pro, The zipper almost scratched the corners as I was Super dissatisfied as it also looked like it could hold my iPad too, but it was all just too tight","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought two of these and they fit a 13 inch MacBook Air perfect and I love the outside zip pocket that can hold a charger and accessories, They`ll still work fine, but it`s annoying and why I knocked off a star","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this for my work laptop, I am very pleased, and have recommended it to co-workers","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely wonderful protective case, Arrived promptly - would recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this case as a stand-alone, quick trip case and love the outside pocket for my phone wallet,  It is very affordable and functions well, so this one is a keeper","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product for my laptop (Asus Zenbook 15\"),  Had this product for almost a year and it still seems like new, zippers are pretty standard and are still holding up","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great case it fits the computer my fianc\u00e9 has like a glove, Even during the pandemic","positive":1},{"review":"  I had ordered the next size down for my light table, Everything I need in one place","positive":1},{"review":"  As I recently purchased a MacBook Pro, the money I spent was too much to not take care of its physical appearances, Fits my backpack with ease","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this sleeve for my 2018 13 inch MacBook Pro (A1989), I`m impressed","positive":1},{"review":"  I searched far and wide for a case sleeve that my 15 inch macbook pro would fit into without having extra space, Also unfortunately, Amazon`s wild west marketplace makes it very difficult to find quality companies like mosiso when searching for laptop sleeves","positive":1},{"review":"  This is not the color you see online, Also, my laptop is the biggest macbook pro 15\" i think idk the biggest one and it still has room left in the case, which I don't mind but just putting that out there","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm happy with the overall quality of this sleeve, Disappointed by that, but it still gets the job done","positive":0},{"review":"  There's something unmistakably cheap and tatty about this case in the flesh, I don't think there's any danger of it tearing or anything, and it does protect a laptop, just know that it's definitely missing anything close to a quality appearance","positive":0},{"review":"  I am giving 3 stars because it is a great quality case that I would definitely love if it was the size I thought I would get, So, I`m sure it`s a great case, just tread carefully when it comes to size","positive":0},{"review":"  This case is NOT specifically designed for a 16\" MacBook Pro 2019 w  Touch Bar, Returning for a case that actually fits","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this for my MacBook Air 13\", It's so tight that the pocket is not functional & won't even hold the charger accessory","positive":0},{"review":"  I was given an inactive 15 dollar girt card and I followed the instructions by email and was emailed back by kumeektech@outlook,","positive":0},{"review":"  This seemed great, Will be looking for something of better quality to replace this","positive":0},{"review":"  Came with several large wrinkles on the front of it, Ended up returning it","positive":0},{"review":"  Cheap bag for simple traveling or limited use,This bag also stained pretty easily","positive":0},{"review":"  For a refurbished product,

chromebook as I am right now","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this Chromebook to use a Linux laptop,This is the fifth or six refurbished computer I have purchased and, as usual, paying attention to the seller feedback, in choosing a vendor seems to increase my chances of getting a good deal","positive":1},{"review":"  As a prolific writer that uses Google Docs for almost everything, this is a real deal and a treat, If you're looking for something with gaming power and storage, you better move on","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased two of these for my Children, Either for my kids or my parents","positive":1},{"review":"  Okay so I'm a Windows 7 user, and had been scared to get a Chromebook for years, because I didn't think that it would do certain things I wanted to do, like play online golf and store files on it that I want to keep,","positive":1},{"review":"  I've read reviews about refurbished equipment, but this Chromebook was great,  It took a few days to get used to, but I really like it","positive":1},{"review":"  I read some good reviews and some bad ones, Customer for LIFE","positive":1},{"review":"  Wow amazing product for the price, Not for gaming or photography","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed a lightweight laptop for traveling and chose this refurbished Dell Chromebook,  Simply stated a perfect little machine","positive":1},{"review":"  The lap top came with a \"manager\" installed on the machine, which I cannot delete or exchange it with,","positive":0},{"review":"  The device itself is in great working order - seems brand new, being that it's refurbished,  It seems to work fine (which, really, is all that matters) but I'm very disappointed in the physical appearance of the product","positive":0},{"review":"  This was purchased as a Christmas gift and was opened by the recipient on December 24,  I am extremely disappointed in this purchase and must now look into returning it for a refund","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing is a piece of crap, This useless waste of money doesn't even run appstore - the fact I was able to hack Linux onto it is the only reason it never went into the trash can and even at that its sitting on a shelf ever since due to the fact that a tortoise covered in molasses in January is faster than this overpriced piece of trash","positive":0},{"review":"  Just unboxed and havent had time to test everything but I wasn't too thrilled with the lack of padding in the box that it was shipped in, These items belong on craigslist not Amazon","positive":0},{"review":"  The device itself looks brand new, but we can`t download any apps, The kids are already over it and don`t want to play with them","positive":0},{"review":"  Had to send back twice because of operation issues, Product looks heavily used with Velcro on the bottom and some sort of weird coating or paint added","positive":0},{"review":"  This is bad when you want to return that they will change you 43 fee, I hope you guys do not choose that  company","positive":0},{"review":"  The product turned on, but my screen has issues, When I pay for a renewed or refurbished item, I don`t expect like new but I wouldn`t expect this issue

this Chromebook for my son, this is his first laptop and I wanted to get something that was durable, lightweight and is great with performance,  I highly recommend this for students and anyone looking for a lightweight, durable and affordable chromebook","positive":1},{"review":"  I don`t really like the mouse pad on this laptop there`s no right click or way to copy and paste, It`s efficient for the basics of internet browsing and schoolwork which I often use it for","positive":1},{"review":"  I am very happy with this bargain,  The battery last long enough but I can't tell exactly as I use the Chromebook only occasionally","positive":1},{"review":"  Christmas gifts for children to do homework,","positive":1},{"review":"  Had an issue but it was resolved most professionally and with great expediency, Would highly recommend Kiko for quality renewed products","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this as a Christmas gift, I did purchase a cover that fits perfectly so that the

far","positive":0},{"review":"  I've never been so disappointed with an Amazon purchase, What exactly is a chromebook good for","positive":0},{"review":"  Cons-Touch pad stinks thankfully I had an old mouse and that works pretty wellkeyboard letters are really hard to see - I had to order replacement stickersNo book or even a suggestion for an online manualThe print was microscopic in size - had to go to YouTube to get a fixIt seems they have all these nuances that you have to learnSo out of the box for a new chromebook user - not easy to useProsReasonably fast for the moneyPrice was dirt cheap at $78,00Delivery was less than 24 hoursConclusion - I have had it one day - no matter what there is a learning curve - once I have that I'll better be able to judge - Overall I think it will do what I need it to do","positive":0},{"review":"  Item was not Touch Screen as described,  Returned it in the end but liked it enough that I'm searching for a newer model","positive":0},{"review":"  I

the battery life is amazing","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this to replace a cheap new one that I bought at the beginning of the school year, At the price of this one if it lasts a year I won't

exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion of this purchased product","positive":1},{"review":"  I truly made the right choice when I picked this lap desk,","positive":1},{"review":"  Item as described, at good price, shipped promptly, It is metal throughout, and so we consider it a bit sturdier than some that are plastic, but it is also quite light, and that means that it does not add much to the laptop weight, making it still easy to lift the \"desk\" + laptop to maneuver getting on or off the sofa","positive":1},{"review":"  This think is ingenious, bug there are some caveats: First, while the legs and deck are aluminium, the joints are plastic,To answer one question posted elsewhere, however, you can remove the legs and the center hinge by removing two screws from either end of the rail, so you can easily swap the small and large surface left-to-right or even remove one entirely if you are so inclined","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought the Pwr+\u00ae FlexTop Portable Folding Laptop Notebook Book Ultrabook Tablet Pad Table Desk Tray Stand - Split Surface - Adjustable- Angle Legs - Up to 15\" - M [ASIN: B00EWQ34ZG] so that I would have a small table to place my 15\" Alien laptop on for when I was in bed,  I really do like this product (now that the small issues were corrected) and use it almost every night","positive":1},{"review":"  Ah- Directions, directions, directions,  I may need to experiment with different arrangements of the legs to find the most stable, if the sideways flex starts bothering me-  like maybe add a stabilizing bar with a couple of c-clamps","positive":1},{"review":"  I had been looking for solutions to allow me to convert my desktop to a sitdown standup without having to change my desk, - just be aware of the actual usable area","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this for my laptop to use in bed while recovering from surgery,I would recommend using this as a temporary aid in bed, given it`s fairly cheap","positive":1},{"review":"  This product looks handy in the photos but ergonomically, it's horrible, I can't recommend this or any other with the same design","positive":0},{"review":"  This is not a folding portable \"desk\" or \"table\" by any stretch of the imaginaton,  Just use a TV dinner tray instead","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this to use in way other than it was designed for, Getting the mouse pad and main table at different angles was also tricky, and required a lot of trial and error","positive":0},{"review":"  I found this to be difficult to figure out how to adjust the height, and a bit flimsy,  I'm probably going to look for something else that is more comfortable for me","positive":0},{"review":"  It works fairly well,  I just wish the quality was better - I wouldn't mind the extra weight and cost","positive":0},{"review":"  Very lightweight which is nice for moving it around to a different room, Good for sitting in bed or a recliner","positive":0},{"review":"  I dislike this product because it was not sturdy, The stand only works when on a flat area","positive":0},{"review":"  They use the term portable to excuse away the fact that this was made to barely handle it's own weight,","positive":0},{"review":"  Have a Gateway MD7309u 15,  I will not put a heavy laptop like mine on it","positive":0},{"review":"  I think this would work great on a table, but it is a little more complicated on the bed which is what I got it for,  I didn't want to go with those because they are bulky, but this is cumbersome enough, that we really don't use it very often","positive":0},{"review":"  First - for full disclosure - I was contacted by the seller and asked to give an unbiased review in exchange for an additional stand,  It has been a good value for me","positive":1},{"review":"  I originally sought out a lap table because I'd broken my leg and needed a comfortable way to work on the couch (reading, using laptop, and grading papers),PS - My leg is healed now, but the stand still gets plenty of use","positive":1},{"review":"  I do presentations at various locations and never know if the height of the stand or table will be the appropriate height for me,  If you just need to extend height on your desk or a table for more comfort, it works great","positive":1},{"review":"  This is good for my purpose:  to hold my keyboard while I stand at my computer desk, Overall I am very happy and would recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  It's exactly what I needed, As an added bonus, a lot of my colleagues have been impressed with my little setup now and find it to be an ingenious, easy fix for implementing a stand-up desk at your workstation - all thanks to this handy stand","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing

use","positive":1},{"review":"  I like to work standing up most of the day -- even when I'm traveling,  I agree with another reviewer that you should probably keep the box as a convenient (and sturdy) carrier, however","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this in hopes it would work for both me and for my wife who is often \"bed bound\" to use to hold her iPad, reading books, laptop, etc,  I would recommend it, but be aware that you will have to search out some answers","positive":1},{"review":"  I use it everyday,It is light weight yet feels sturdy","positive":1},{"review":"  It's really not as easy to position as I thought and the \"feet\" rests are only good on flat surfaces, Overall, I thought it was a decent product","positive":0},{"review":"  This is VERY flimsy and the mouse area is too narrow,  The whole Item would be better if it didn't flex but I find the flexing too anoying for daily use","positive":0},{"review":"  I would give it 5 starts if following things are improved:1,The company should add 6 lips, 3 on laptop side in the front, 2 on the sides, and 1 on the mouse side","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this to try and convert my sitting desk into a standing desk and or make my laptop position more ergonomic when sitting, It's a good value if you don't need to move it very much but I would probably opt for the more expensive standing desk options if I needed to change the position much more frequently","positive":0},{"review":"  This product seemed to be the most budget conscious and out of all the competitors it seemed as if it's mechanics were the most adjustable to fit any ergonomic position, Using it for gaming was out of the question","positive":0},{"review":"  Review for the model with the mouse extension:Works after some modification,Overall, it works fine now, it's a bit cheap feeling and could use some type of rubber feet to prevent slipping and provide stability","positive":0},{"review":"  Of all the settings for this folding laptop table, I finally gave up on it,  I have another different folding laptop table that I never use for the same reasons","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price, this thing is made pretty cheaply, Lowering another star for that","positive":0},{"review":"  This is an OK product if you're looking for something affordable and simple,) I will use this on and off even though it's less than ideal because I want to alternate between sitting while working and standing","positive":0},{"review":"  Very flimsy construction, just a bit thicker than an aluminium foil,Returned immediately","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price on here, it is very much worth the price, For the materials, and design work put into this it should actually be around twice it's actual price","positive":1},{"review":"  This has turned out to be a pretty handy item to have around, Overall, I'm a happy camper","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this specifically to elevate my laptop at work to standing height and I've never used it any other way, I just hook the ridges of my laptop over the back edge of the tray though so I'm not sure how sturdy the pop-up would be","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm stuck in bed or on the couch for ten weeks due to a fractured foot and torn ligament,  Quite stable","positive":1},{"review":"  I use two of these to make a standing desk anywhere,Overall a great product for DIY and mobile stand up desks","positive":1},{"review":"  I have really enjoyed the convenience, versatility, and usefulness of this stand, I mainly love this table just because it served its purpose: allowing me to use my tiny laptop anywhere, and making it easier on my back and neck","positive":1},{"review":"  I am disabled and have to spend most of my time in bed, Ive been using this one daily for over 2 months and it's holding up well","positive":1},{"review":"  It is a nice product,Overall, it is a nice device and has helped me work in bed more comfortably","positive":1},{"review":"  The notebook stand definitely does what it says, This is one of the most important pieces of furniture in my apartment today","positive":1},{"review":"  I actually use this so I can use a portable monitor and my laptop on the same level (rather than using the smaller panel for my mouse), I've addressed that issue by keeping a rubberized drawer liner in my work bag and putting that between the stand and the monitor","positive":1},{"review":"  too lightweight, I returned it","positive":0},{"review":"  Not what I expected,  It has to be flat for the mouse","positive":0},{"review":"  I received it broken,  I received it broken","positive":0},{"review":"  I am disappointed in this, I feel taken advantage of","positive":0},{"review":"  Just received this today, Also, there is a noticeable sag between the split tray","positive":0},{"review":"  Very light, and flexible with infinite ways to position,  Weight makes it very portable, but not easy to take along on commute or travel as it is long because of the mouse platform","positive":0},{"review":"  Update: Lowered it form 5 stars to 3, Just keep it simple with this thing","positive":0},{"review":"  Adjustment takes more time and patience, A inexpensive solution to standing","positive":0},{"review":"  Returned, Very firmsy","positive":0},{"review":"  It is pretty flimsy, I feel that if I rest my hand on the mouse to hard, or rest my wrist too hard, it would collapse","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm a consultant and this portable standing desk is great for my work lifestyle (traveling to clients and working from my laptop),3) Good quality material","positive":1},{"review":"  I had a little difficulty learning how to adjust the legs at first, I use this with a surface and sometimes to lift my desktop keyboard and convert my desk to a standing desk","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this riser, The riser helps me tomaintain the correct posture and I'm not as uncomfortable after working several hours","positive":1},{"review":"  I really needed a lap table to use while I am in bed typing,  Give had it for so e time now and expect it to last very long","positive":1},{"review":"  While I wish that this table was a little longer and had either a longer or second lip it works great, I can bear down very heavily on it without any indications of stress","positive":1},{"review":"  First off I do love this thing, I would definitely recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  This was the perfect, reasonably priced desk top stand for my lap top for use with my treadmill at my desk,  Tip - if your stand slides on your desk, you can use a small rug gripper mat to keep it perfectly still","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a decently heavy 15, I wish it could come with fans and a mouse section, but I'm glad I went with this one","positive":1},{"review":"  The fact that this adjustable laptop table can be used lying down comfortably is worth the price it self, My sister had troubles with her back while long study periods and then I surprised her with this adjustable laptop portable table","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this table for my husband who is an advid pc gamer but we had no table space for him to play so we found this,Overall I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a way to elevate a laptop or for doing paper work while sitting in comfort on their couch","positive":1},{"review":"  it's a little flimsy, If it were heavier it would be more stable","positive":0},{"review":"  it works,","positive":0},{"review":"  Needed something to get laptop off my legs while sitting on couch, Overall seems decently made but have only used it for 6 weeks","positive":0},{"review":"  Love this versatile desk,Thanks","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is very flimsy and doesn`t support my MacBook Air well, I will be returning it to the seller","positive":0},{"review":"  Although it's a pain to change from one angle to another, the standing feature is great,  I like that feature","positive":0},{"review":"  I returned it because I couldn't get use to how complicated it was to set up and to fold back up, I didn't want to have to think about how to undo it each time when I was tired and ready to turn in at night","positive":0},{"review":"  The videos make it so easy to move up and down, wobbly","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased the split version and there is a very noticeable sag bows where the laptop tray and mouse tray are split,  Very sturdy and well made","positive":0},{"review":"  Great design however a little weak with a full size laptop, The legs bow out a but","positive":0},{"review":"  Straight off the bat, I must tell you that this chrome

Time-waster","positive":0},{"review":"  We were really excited to receive this Chromebook for my kids' elearning for the rest of the school year, I know this is probably an isolated issue, and not all

and portable","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a decent laptop for the current list price, It is certainly not the best laptop you can buy, but it is much better than a cheap windows laptop I bought recently while on a business trip","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my second Chromebook, and it's on the basic side as far as features go,All in all this is a really nice budget Chromebook, and it would be perfect for a student, or just someone on a budget that wants most of the functionality of a full laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  Battery lasts long compared to some other models and

recognized","positive":0},{"review":"  One of My Best Purchases Ever,- Very sturdy and stable, I have my computer normally raised about 18 inches above my desk and have never had it tip overCons:- It took a little practice to get the stand set up the way I wanted, but once I saw the angle indicators on each leg and used them as guides, it became really easy to adjust it from one position to another- When placed on a desk, it can slide around a bit if you bump into it, but that hasn`t been an issue for meOverall, I`m very impressed with this laptop stand and would highly recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  6 25 2018 UPDATE: Still love this stand, got a new HP OMEN on it now and very sturdy, Nice piece of black painted 16 ga aluminum","positive":1},{"review":"  This is

laptop stand, I'd recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  This is just about exactly what I was looking for,I love it though","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this chill pad and use it daily,  But once you get it into your position it works great and makes surfing much more comfortable","positive":1},{"review":"  I often draw on my iPad while on the couch, in bed, at a table and all of these

complete hassle","positive":0},{"review":"  Love it, I do recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  I don't give anything 5 stars,  Comes assembled, just have to just the legs to where you are comfortable","positive":1},{"review":"  It does what it's mean't for, and clicks in many different shapes and forms with legs to fit your needs, laying down no problem, sitting up no issues besides you moving on a bed and the keyboard and mouse will tend to slide around, It would be great for an artist or someone with a laptop or tablet, not and external keyboard and mouse","positive":1},{"review":"  Was looking for something to use while I was sitting on the couch and trying to use my computer,","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn't expect much and was happily

progress in my project, because of the issue, so both Amazon and the provider got 1 star, As the performance of this laptop I think would be okay, but for the money I decided to build my on desktop tower and put much more power for the buck than having this laptop, I know is portable, but to be honest I have a MacBook pro that can handle short projects even in 4k, so no rush I can go back home and kick it with a AMD TR4, I just build, so consider your options up front, I know it's frustrating but at the end we all have different needs and I think MSI or ROG systems are just fine and can load good work, or consider something like CUK for a bit more performance in laptops","positive":0},{"review":"  The screen was sharp, and it does covers almost 100% Adobe RGB,I thought it consisted of an AUO 41EB panel after I read notebookcheck's review of its 9880H version, but the panel of the version I bought was from Sharp","positive":0},{"review":"  I got really excited when seeing the price of this laptop comparing to others with same specifications, However, if you wear headphones when playing game or editing movies it shouldn't be a problem","positive":0},{"review":"  My review

for a thin and light ultrabook with heavy specs, then you can go for this one","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop had the features I wanted: a large SSD, a lot of RAM and Windows 10 Pro,  And it's really light if you are going to be toting it around","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer lags a bit with some games (granted, so far, the game it lags with most is five years old and wasn't coded well) but most importantly, I had to spend an additional $200 on a replacement power cord right out of the gate, because the one that came with the computer was very much the wrong one and wouldn't charge the laptop, If I wanted a computer that only really works when it's plugged in, I would have bought a desktop","positive":1},{"review":"  I just recieved this today, but my best friend

video editing and overall high  performance work","positive":1},{"review":"  Exactly what I needed to replace my computer, This is the best computer to me","positive":1},{"review":"  i wanted to move

returned it","positive":0},{"review":"  If it were still working, I'd probably give it four stars, I can't find a repair person willing to take on this task, and MSI hasn't been any help since it's

so now and it stopped my laptop from burning my legs to keeping it cool as the laptop fans are garbage as I have a HP pavillion and they are known for over heating, The one thing I do not like which is due to my own fault is if you pick it up wrong and the bar to keep it up right is in the right spot you may pinch yourself","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this cooling pad for about a month,  It's not world changing, but it's probably the best $20 cooling stand you'll find on Amazon","positive":1},{"review":"  Sized so that 15\" or 17\" MacBooks will fit,  These two fans run relatively slowly compared to some","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this cooling pad on my lap while watching TV,  I would recommend purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought the version that has the hundreds of holes in it, I'm using it under my 17\" HP laptop, and there would be very little overhang except one of the tabs to keep the laptop from sliding covers up the hole for the speakers, and I had to shift it over about two inches","positive":1},{"review":"  Working with the laptop on my lap is fabulous, A nice fan that's extending my laptop and my lap","positive":1},{"review":"  Cooling pad has been working great in the months since I got it, Love it","positive":1},{"review":"  These are great, This is a great laptop cooling desk","positive":1},{"review":"  Obviously this power pad will tilt for you,Hands down the best I have found, even when going to other High-End stores, which only mark up the cost for overall profit, andnot care about quality and the end-user","positive":1},{"review":"  WARNING:  The product has been changed substantially since this review was first posted,  A more engineering person could probably keep this working for a lot longer (maybe with a metal pin pole, but I'm going to look for a newer product that is similar but hopefully lacks the few drawbacks","positive":0},{"review":"  I initially really liked it, but have had issues because it is very annoying to adjust, I think if they added a removable counterweight I would be more than happy with the product but as it is i have to use books to prevent it from constantly tipping over","positive":0},{"review":"  Well,","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is designed quite nice, Save your 55 bucks","positive":0},{"review":"  i really like this product,2 big fans run quietly and guaranteed to keep your notebook coolcouple of things:power cord should be detachable have storage area as it great for just using as a standthere's no power switch, plug it in and the fan is always onit's too big for my 13\" macbook but that's ok","positive":0},{"review":"  In summary, three problems: one due design and two due low quality,Would be five stars without these issues","positive":0},{"review":"  This worked great for about 6 weeks, Maybe i got a lemon, but I would not recommend it based on a short lifespan","positive":0},{"review":"  Slides on pad when you have to move it around, Should have a way that laptop does not slide on pad, maybe with some velcrow","positive":0},{"review":"  I think I expected more from this, I now am not even using it,","positive":0},{"review":"  Really big and wish there wasn't a blue light, otherwise works ok,","positive":0},{"review":"  Before finding this on amazon I had never heard of this product, I'm glad I've found something to slow down the destruction","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a MacBook Pro laptop that is about 5-1 2 years old,[1] some later MacBook Pros have slots for incoming cooling airflow instead of using holes in the keyboard","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this because my HP Envy is overworked in my business, If you need a cooling pad, this would be the one","positive":1},{"review":"  Price to performance of this product is outstanding, Over all it is a great product and would order another if needed","positive":1},{"review":"  I was anxious to receive my PWR Laptop Cooler, as I had issues with my laptop overheating,","positive":1},{"review":"  If you're looking for a cooling stand for your laptop, you've come to the right place, Do not hesitate, it's that good","positive":1},{"review":"  After ankle surgery I became essentially bed bound and bored out of my mind, It runs really quietly and is comfortable on my lap","positive":1},{"review":"  ALL METAL TOP,  Packed well and quick shipping","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a great setup, simple and affordable, Games that would bog my computer down from running too hot now stay smooth and my lap doesn't burn","positive":1},{"review":"  A friend showed his stand to me and I liked it so much I got one,  Very good if you use your laptop at all","positive":1},{"review":"  VERY convenient,Not as pleased as I was when I first received it","positive":0},{"review":"  Noisy, Tabs at bottom to hold laptop in-place poke uncomfortably into bottom of your wrist, and no pass-thru USB plug for power to fan so you don't lose a USB slot on your computer just for power,Good: best fan and air-flow to laptop I've seen, after 3 tried and discarded","positive":0},{"review":"  So first off, I will say, this product works great, They just need to change the description to account for the 2 inch discrepancy","positive":0},{"review":"  Doesnt cool the laptop at all,  Doesnt cool the laptop at all","positive":0},{"review":"  Did not work, DOA","positive":0},{"review":"  We are happy with the unit but there are several shortcomings that I feel should be addressed, Every time you move the bracket kicks out and you have to reset it","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased the mesh stand with two 140mm fans, You can see that the side spillage is fairly bright","positive":1},{"review":"  5 stars on this product, Wonderful product","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the first cooling pad I have ever used so I do not know of any other models in the market, Even then I would definitely recommend this product to my friends for all the other features","positive":1},{"review":"  A little weak feeling, but holds my 14 inch laptop just fine, Then I couldve given it 5 stars, as it is exactly as described","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great fan and lowered the temperature of my Dell Studio by 10 degree C,  I also have multiple HAVIT HV-F2050 which work well, but are not as quiet as the Pwr+ 17 and they cool the same laptop by 6 degrees C","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product, The company was very helpful and followed up to check on my satisfaction","positive":1},{"review":"  Fans are quiet and seem slow but it keeps my computer cool even when I am rendering video on adobe premiere, Also, I like the gap created underneath the laptop by the stand as it is a great place to put my cell, burt's bees and other things like pens where they wont roll around and are easy to keep track of","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this fan to replace another one I had, what I like most is the cord is connected to the back and not a separate USB cord that would keep falling off like my prior one,  I would buy again if I ever need it","positive":1},{"review":"  This fan was pretty much what I expected going in, Also, my laptop is larger than 17\" and the fan still supports it and cools it down just fine, my laptop just hangs over the side a bit","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a 17\" HP laptop that over heats and this product solves that problem, I am satisfied with my purchase and would buy again","positive":1},{"review":"  These cooling pads are great, if not a little fragile, Cools down a laptop so well I can play at HD for hours","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great way to keep your laptop cool,So glad I bought one","positive":1},{"review":"  I use it for my 15, Don't think it's only restricted to 17\" macbooks","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best one I've found, and I've bought several different kinds,","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to replace another brand's stand that quit working after seven months of use,perfect for my needs","positive":1},{"review":"  Use it every day and it does the trick, Service was quick","positive":1},{"review":"  Everything I was looking for in a cooling stand, I like how the black handles lift up so it holds my laptop in place, I can adjust the angle and it stays in place, the fan is quiet, and the lots of cool air blows underneath","positive":1},{"review":"  At first I was concerned this would look a bit geeky, or not exactly follow through on keeping my computer's temp down,  Awesome product, doesn't look too overboard, and I really like how it elevates my computer and makes it feel like my laptop is more of a desktop when I'm at home","positive":1},{"review":"  Exactly what was advertised and for a good price, Minor inconveniences only","positive":1},{"review":"  My Macbook Pro was overheating constantly,  Glad I picked it up","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this laptop because it specifically said it had a webcam, which is necessary for me to work from home during the COVID-19 Stay-at-home orders, The laptop was a good one and fairly priced, I would have kept it if I didn't need it specifically for the webcam itself","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop exceeds my expectations,  The new (to me) Dell Latitude is now driving two screens, and it works just fine","positive":1},{"review":"  Shipping was fast, Would definitely purchase again from this vendor, this laptop model","positive":1},{"review":"  The pc works very good, I study and watch News everyday,","positive":1},{"review":"  The computer works fine, The company quickly solved the situation","positive":1},{"review":"  We bought a lap top that was suppose to have a camera, I highly recommend them","positive":1},{"review":"  A great buy, would use same company again for next computer purchase,  A great buy, would use same company again for next computer purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  Very happy for the product, the computer is in very good condition, it also arrived on time, the purchase exceeded my expectations, 10 10","positive":1},{"review":"  This has been a great buy and customer service was awesome when we had a minor problem, Would buy again","positive":1},{"review":"  Great condition and product, but for some reason it comes with a Spanish keyboard,  It's not difficult to figure out what the buttons mean, but it makes it difficult to send emails","positive":0},{"review":"  It was great till the 90-day warranty expired,  Okay, if you don't expect it to last longer","positive":0},{"review":"  I received the equipment in very good condition however, even though in the specification text it says that the keyboard is in Spanish, I received the equipment with an English keyboard,  I received the equipment in very good condition

description,  It has no camera as it says in the description","positive":0},{"review":"  Usable, but expected better,","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0I've been using it for 2 weeks now, The one I got was the i5 7300HQMinecraft - 60 FPS consistentDark Souls II - 60 FPS consistentWitcher 3 - 30 FPS  (Lowest I saw was 27)I guess the two biggest drawbacks for me is the battery life which I only got around 3 hours with for using analytics software","positive":1},{"review":"  First off I've only had the PC for a couple days, The trackpad isn't very good in my opinion but I always use a wireless mouse so I didn't write this down as a CON","positive":1},{"review":"  I am impressed, I was curious what kind of performance I would get on PUBG and I was not disappointed","positive":1},{"review":"  Honestly this was one of the best laptops I've ever owned, as far as price to performance goes, for a couple of reasons:-Easy upgrades, However, that caveat aside, this is still a very good price to performance machine","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros ConsPros:- Battery life holds up so far (went from 4 hours to 2 hours in 6 months but I use it constantly)- Light compared to other gaming laptops- Decent processing speed-1050 2gb is enough for light gaming-Has extra upgrade slots (HDD and RAM)-Customizable ECO and SPORT modes built in-Great coolingCons:-Loud mouse buttons-Feels a little cheap material wise (i, vents on the bottom, planting molding but not much of a con)-1050 will struggle with high end gaming, so will the processorOverall:Great laptop for college (if you play light games like me) and want to have some word processing qualities too","positive":1},{"review":"  I settled on this laptop after browsing a lot of different options for a new gaming pc, Would recommend as a college student cause its cheap, fast, works for schoolwork, can run demanding programs, and obviously can run games","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this laptop for over 6 months now and the only thing I don't like is that I didn't get the back lit key board, Other than that this is a awesome laptop, faster than all of my old gaming laptops and desk tops","positive":1},{"review":"  Husband LOVES this computer, We rigged it up with an additional fan because he is on it so much but works excellent for gaming and general uses","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this laptop, I love it","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my first laptop purchase ever and my first Windows 10 computer, I bought a sleeve and a case for it making it ready for travel","positive":1},{"review":"  The ONLY reason why i bought this laptop instead of ones similar for 20+- dollars is because those laptops dont have the dedicated right and left buttons that i absolutely need to have, Its not worth a 700 price tag","positive":0},{"review":"  Upon arrival of my laptop, I have been having issues with my sound,","positive":0},{"review":"  Works fine for PC gaming when it actually works, Do yourself a favor and spend the extra little bit of cash to get a better unit from a company that doesn't sell fast-breaking rubbish","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0It`s VALUE for Gaming, Everyone or the Universe please help me","positive":0},{"review":"  Purchased this laptop less than four months ago and the monitor has started to blackout while using,  I would not recommend this laptop","positive":0},{"review":"  I loved this laptop,until it stopped working after 8 months, Sigh","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the laptop's performace, but as i write this review, i am in pain by the fact that the space bar keeps sticking,It sucks because it was a real pain in the butt to add a hard drive to it, tons of little screws","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall the speed and quality of the laptop is pretty good for some light work or gaming, If you don't want to download a program to combine them and you don't want split drives this probably isn't for you","positive":0},{"review":"  The memory isn't so great if you want to put a bunch of high end games on it, I heard you can do that","positive":0},{"review":"  I thought this would smoke my 8 year old desktop which has 16 gb of ram but it is slower, I broke the headphone jack after 3 months though","positive":0},{"review":"  I love this new machine,)Cons:  Small HD, but easily upgradeable","positive":1},{"review":"  I really enjoy having it, Other than that it`s perfect for a casual gamer who doesn`t want everything on Ultra High","positive":1},{"review":"  Love the value for this laptop amazing little piece of tech, However, I purchased doom on steam to really push it and have had no issues running it at ultra settings once the ram was installed","positive":1},{"review":"  Okay, so the only problem I've had with this product would be the audio issues,Turns out it happened to be the Nahimac software interfering with the audio","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought for my son in October, Let`s see how it holds until next October","positive":1},{"review":"  I`m writing this review after a year and one month after purchase,Oh and I saw a review that said the fan was too loud not sure if he was referring to the normal fan or the high intensity fan option which can be activated with a button","positive":1},{"review":"  To be fair, this is my first gaming laptop, Does not have a CD thing, so be prepared to have to find drivers online for any extra stuff (mouse, printer, w e) you're going to add","positive":1},{"review":"  Battery life sucks on this thing compared to other machines I`ve used in the past, Worth my money, and it`s worth yours too","positive":1},{"review":"  Had to send the original in for keyboard replacement after about a month, I feel like the plastic around the screen is a little too flexible","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this during a prime day deal, I am very happy with this purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  Worked great for 2 years but now the screen is flickering and getting worse, the build quality around the screen is very flimsy","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop completely died on me like full on system failure, Sent it various computer repair stores and they all said it was irreparable","positive":0},{"review":"  Bad material, it's really delicate,After 10 months, one of the pieces fell off","positive":0},{"review":"  The keyboard started failing out of nothing,Sorry for the mistakes writing butthe keyboard is working bad","positive":0},{"review":"  While this laptop is amazing for gaming at it's price, it's battery life and durability are laughable,I would have given this a much higher rating had it not been for today, where a corner of the plastic casing chipped off despite the laptop not being dropped or anything","positive":0},{"review":"  Bad parts,  Bad parts","positive":0},{"review":"  I love the computer, Other than the battery I enjoy it and would recommend this computer","positive":0},{"review":"  Gaming laptop is laughable, Vanilla Minecraft on single player world, high settings on laptop and still lag spikes down to 13fps smh","positive":0},{"review":"  Arrived friday,  turned it on and got blue screens and when it finally works,  the Nvidia graphics card doesn't appear or even work, Expected better","positive":0},{"review":"  I returned it,  It is a good computer, but just could not part with my Macbook Pro","positive":0},{"review":"  The Laptop is amazing it can run most games with high graphics (Csgo Overwatch Fortnite Etc ), For the price, it's extremely good it's\u200b also really convenient to fit into a backpack and go on the go","positive":1},{"review":"  It hasn't let us down yet after several months of use, As we can only have two large game on it at a time","positive":1},{"review":"  best by for the money , i love this laptop, and im really picky, took me 3 weeks to decide to buy this one i got the one with the SSD,","positive":1},{"review":"  Good for the price, If you want to play the latest games in highest settings and 60fps, I recommend you save for a better model","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer is great for the lite gaming I do,And great for the hardcore gaming my Fiance does","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been looking at new old computers for a while and this one fit everything on my list,  Screen resolution looks great while playing games, although it does tend to heat up after a couple hours of constant playing","positive":1},{"review":"  Well when I was writing this review, I accidently  closed out Amazon, So I'm not going to say anything but show some photos","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice computer extremely fast boot up and fairly fast loading apps and games, Pleased with laptop and no bloatware win

reason, they refused to post my last review, despite the fact that there was no obscene content in it, so let me break it down extra special, The screen is beautiful and the keyboard is more mechanical-like than the Dell I returned to get this, but it's completely unusable because of this issue (I don't even know if there's a name for it because I've never seen or heard of this before)","positive":0},{"review":"  This MSI laptop will satisfy the needs of many customers, but perhaps not those who are enticed by the headline,If none of those issues seem particularly problematic, then the price tag of $650 to $730 should make this an acceptable purchase","positive":0},{"review":"  Ugh, don't bother with this waste of space, Buy from a real company","positive":0},{"review":"  Package can on time, please add extra packing material, at least for peace of mind","positive":0},{"review":"  Great laptop but its not oculus rift compatible,

sitting on my couch, (I would suggest that you write down the multiple degree settings once you find your comfortable position to make that comfortable position(s) easy to

recommended to do this once in a while, a lot less back pain),Been working great, I'd buy another if this one ever gives up as it was a good price and good quality","positive":1},{"review":"  This stand lasted 3 1 2 years before one of the leg joints completely broke,5 years of use though","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this thing,I keep the tray horizontal for working on my laptop, but it only takes a few seconds to tilt it upward for reading a book, newspaper, tablet, &c","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been hoping for such a product for many years, so I was grateful to find one that has so many great features, Clearly I have some inconsistent desires here","positive":1},{"review":"  I am pretty happy with this purchase, It collapses nice and flat to stow away or take with you","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this just under a year ago from the advice of some random person who recommended it as a standing desk on Hacker News, However, if you're thinking about a laptop stand in this style to raise your desk to standing level, I would not hesitate in purchasing this stand","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this tray and especially the rubber guard at the bottom where the computer rests, Overall, it meets my needs and I recommend it with precautions as stated","positive":1},{"review":"  To start with, the website description '100% Aluminum Alloy Composition ' is inaccurate, it has at least  all joints made of plastic, every time I put my 15\" Pro on this the legs spread a bit and it certainly doesn't feel sturdy while using the keyboard for typing,I bought this due to misleading website description, not worth the money","positive":0},{"review":"  I, like many, use my laptop while on the sofa etc, I'll probably keep trying but this is not the laptop stand for me","positive":0},{"review":"  I spent time searching on Amazon for a tray table to use on the couch and bed,  It might be the best choice if you envision a variety of users or using it in different places, but I think I would have been happier with a less adjustable one if I could have been more sure it would be the proper height","positive":0},{"review":"  Well, It's okay,  Avoid using it under long time high temperature or low temperature environment to protect your skin","positive":0},{"review":"  While this stand ultimately does the job, it's really not easy to adjust, But every time I have to change positions and adjust the stand, my heart sinks a little","positive":0},{"review":"  I hate this thing,  Returning it","positive":0},{"review":"  I recently bought this laptop stand during a Gold Box deal and was a bit disappointed when it arrived, Overall I'm not exactly unhappy that I paid $40 for the tray, but I would not pay more than that otherwise having now used it","positive":0},{"review":"  Very difficult to set up so it's just right, and when it is to my liking it does not feel like it holds my laptop securely nor on any other setting, The price point seemed a bit high when buying the product which made me believe that it would be a better quality stand but I was sadly mistaken","positive":0},{"review":"  I was really looking forward to this thing,Overall, it does what I wanted, but very poorly","positive":0},{"review":"  Independent positions are very hard to set, I regret having to return it on account of its practical flaws","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop stand can be used in bed, on a lay-out couch, as a mini-podium to turn a low table into a standing desk, or just folded up to angle your keyboard up and raise up the screen a few inches, There's so many things you could do with it","positive":1},{"review":"  UPDATE: Well, I wished I'd bought two in my original review,Note: I didn't get the mouse pad attachment b c I prefer having the mouse pad on the bed","positive":1},{"review":"  This works for the purpose I wanted, and it did immediately, She seems to like the cave-like feeling that the desk makes at 90 degree angles","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently converted to a laptop gamer from being a desktop gamer,  It is so much better than my old lap pillow system and I am very glad that I purchased it","positive":1},{"review":"  I am absolutely OBSESSED with this product, Could not be happier with this versatile product - a must-have","positive":1},{"review":"  I have to admit, I chose it because it's purple, If your intension is to leave it in one position all the time then it's superb","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been using this as a stand-up desk at home and I really like that it's fully adjustable (remove laptop first),","positive":1},{"review":"  This has made reading so much easier in bed and to hold papers in my chair,  I think if it was 2-3\" narrower, I would like it better, but too much and it would be difficult to straddle the hips","positive":1},{"review":"  I was studying for the Bar Exam and had thousands upon thousands of pages with tiny print to absorb and it was taking a toll on my shoulders and neck, EXCELLENT","positive":1},{"review":"  Now that I've had this product a couple of weeks, I LOVE IT, It will seem awkward in the beginning but once you get the hang of it, you'll find it a very functional and useful","positive":1},{"review":"  I had modest hopes and was still a little disappointed, If you need to tilt you laptop past 20 degrees or so, this product won't help you","positive":0},{"review":"  I guess it's OK, work in a standing position, this is not the right product","positive":0},{"review":"  I haven't used this much since I got it, Maybe I'll get used to it","positive":0},{"review":"  It is very versatile, So I'm chucking it for another","positive":0},{"review":"  I really liked this product, While the product is not as durable as I would like, I have to give this product 3 stars based on the function and the customer service","positive":0},{"review":"  I'd give this thing negative stars if I could,","positive":0},{"review":"  This is best used in ONE location, as readjusting it every place I used my laptop took much too long, It got too cumbersome after a few days, I returned it","positive":0},{"review":"  It is easy to adjust,  So I use it for other purpose","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had this for several months, If you just want an easy peasy way to not have your neck hurt while working on your computer-AVOID","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchases this to enable me to work standing, when I need to, a job which is does satisfy,Better yet, compared to the cost of a standing desk, it was a steal","positive":0},{"review":"  The Furinno Adjustable Vented Laptop Table is wonderful, For sitting on the couch to work and watch tv it is simply awesome","positive":1},{"review":"  Oh my goodness, this little piece of laptop joy is incredible,  Where has this been all my laptop life","positive":1},{"review":"  This vented laptop table bed tray definitely takes getting use to - if you just slow down and use the instructional booklet which shows almost every possible variation and the helpful settings, you will probably enjoy the use of this product,Bottom line, 4 stars overall, if the edges were buffed out a little and it was a tad sturdier, I'd definitely give it 5 stars","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently had neck surgery and just holding my iPad to read caused so much discomfort to my shoulders and because of my neck brace I couldn't prop it up on something because I couldn't look down,If you are thinking about purchasing a laptop table, I would go with this one hands down","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this computer stand,  With this sleek stand, end the hunching","positive":1},{"review":"  Although it took a few tries to get in the groove of changing the height, I love this product, So happy with this item","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this pretty well, but it is shorter than I expected,  One photo is a little small, but shows a greater variety - they are from the manufacturer's instructions","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this to get me through some post-surgery, Highly recommended","positive":1},{"review":"  I wasn't sure about this when it came in, but after using it for awhile I love it,  I highly recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an absolutely brilliantly executed product, I have a second one that I use in bed to get my iPad up to my line of sight","positive":1},{"review":"  this product came promptly, I will keep it as it is usable and when supported on the bed it is good","positive":0},{"review":"  This is not a good item, The concept is good but the plastic hinges need to be rethought","positive":0},{"review":"  cool tool -sturdy, lightweight, easy to adjust,  my computer has an 11 inch depth so this didn't work for me","positive":0},{"review":"  ok here it is, I do love it for it's purpose, but adjusting it to fit the size you want was so frustrating, it's not that easy and i found myself wrestling it,Other than that, i love its purpose and color","positive":0},{"review":"  Good concept, poor execution, just not this make and model","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm not really sure about this thing yet,  However, if I'm just reading on my laptop or watching videos, it works fine","positive":0},{"review":"  Looks good but flimsy, you have to play a lot to make sure the thing is stable especially if you watch from different angles,","positive":0},{"review":"  The product is as they say just okay,It is sturdy and once adjusted worked well","positive":0},{"review":"  Takes a lot to adjust as you have to push buttons on both sides at each joint, But I found it too high-maintinence even for the flexibility it offered","positive":0},{"review":"  Great positioning, The rubber lip holds my mini iPad perfectly, unless balance is transferred such as a mattress","positive":0},{"review":"  I do a lot of late night work on my laptop and iPad as well as watch Netflix and Amazon Prime Movies on both devices,  Nice quality of materials and overall an elegantly designed tool","positive":1},{"review":"  I watch a lot of movies on my laptop while laying in bed, I love the pink it's very pretty but green is my favorite color and I would have preferred it over pink","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this because I work at a computer all day and wanted a way to stand while working, I wish I had like three of these in college to keep all my books and notes on","positive":1},{"review":"  Great little laptop accessory, But it's not difficult, you just have to take your laptop off the table first","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros: super lightweight, you could probably travel with the thing, Good value","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a chronic illness that can keep me in bed for months with only my laptop for entertainment, But it is worth the mobility I regain and knowing that it is solidly constructed","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this to hold my iPad Pro, Goodluck to you in getting your workspace comfortable","positive":1},{"review":"  I would have given it 5 stars, but there is one issue, it's a bit hard to get the right angles, it takes some time to play with it to get it just right,  I'm glad they have it in many colors","positive":1},{"review":"  I love the flexibility this gives me,  I understand one can buy a special attachment for this, so I may look into it","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a handy piece of gear to have, Overall though, this is a very useful item","positive":1},{"review":"  Legs don't extend evenly,  Never again","positive":0},{"review":"  I was excited to receive this item that I thought would be perfect for my SurfacePro tablet PC and school text books, for either tabletop or lap use,*does fit large text book nicely","positive":0},{"review":"  One joint stopped locking making the entire thing useless,  Would not recommend this product","positive":0},{"review":"  It moves so much when I am typing that it's hard for my eyes to focus, Don't know if my item was defective","positive":0},{"review":"  This table looks really cool, I love the silver color and all of the different positions it can be put in but it is not sturdy enough for my son's Alienware laptop so we had to order another one, We kept this one b c I plan to use it to hold other things that are lighter in weight or maybe I'll give it to a friend whose daughter is in band (it would be perfect to hold sheet music)","positive":0},{"review":"  Have used the product for a day and so far it seems like all of the joints are made slightly different, I have not decided if I will return it or not","positive":0},{"review":"  just plain junk,  just plain junk","positive":0},{"review":"  Despite the best efforts by the product itself, the postures it allows just are not good for real work,","positive":0},{"review":"  Cheap, AND you need an engineering degree to follow the positions   arrangements they provide","positive":0},{"review":"  Lightweight, does the trick but, is totally annoying to position, Did not seem to be much else out there to purchase so I suggest the product with the understanding that it is hard to adjust","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this webcam because I am a teacher that I have to teach online (by Google meet or Zoom) during this period of epidemic prevention at home, 100% will recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had quite a few webcams over the years and it seems like the two main issues I've run into are the ability for it to stay on the monitor and the ability to get the right angle, As far as the picture goes I haven't been disappointed in webcams I've owned in years so although it does look great that might just be the standard nowadays","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this piece because it's the perfect size and sits neatly on my computer,","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, I really like the webcam,I'll just have to use a separate microphone with this webcam","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my son to use for his online classes,  Great item","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered and arrived the next day, Microphone is clear and stable as long as you have great

most about this is that you can charge using with usb cable, solar power or hand crank","positive":1},{"review":"  Baby is too practical, read the product description, a variety of uses: the radio

 This is a very handy item for certain situations,  The battery is perfect for charging USB devices","positive":1},{"review":"  I was AMAZED at the difference in sound quality from such a cheap mic, Thank you again","positive":1},{"review":"  I had ordered this inexpensive microphone to be used as a replacement for the 'removable' microphone that came with a gaming headset I had purchased about 9 months prior, just a microphone","positive":1},{"review":"  The 3,  I had originally tried a Sony ECM-CS3 lavalier mic which provided excellent audio at stationary to low speeds, but created a most annoying pop click clip effect at speeds over 65mph","positive":1},{"review":"  Its a cheap microphone that does what microphones do BUT one major design flaw is a lack of a fold out leg that could catch on the edge of the laptop to preven the mic from simply spinning in the input jack and flopping around which is exactly what it does, For the price, it does its job and I only took away one star for the inconvenience of having to 'rig' it to stay still","positive":1},{"review":"  I had a USB microphone, but it fell apart, But it works perfectly for me and for the price, I'm very happy with it","positive":1},{"review":"  The close proximity to the computer can pick up fan noise, but the noise wasn't too bad,  This mic seemed to have too much noise for a voice recognition app that was my primary purchase justification, but the problem might have been the software and not the microphone","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a USFF desktop (small) that sits in front of me and holds my monitor, If you use it a bit and find you need or want a better mic, it would be worth it just for doing that","positive":1},{"review":"  I as a youtuber, hated my computer mic, I assumed it lost by the 29th","positive":1},{"review":"  For a cheap mic it worked well, I lost mine but I will find them eventually, So if you have expensive headphones and want a cheap option to ad a mic pick one of these up","positive":1},{"review":"  I wanted a way to use my high quality headphones (which don't have a mic) while Skyping, but didn't want to also run a second wire just for a mic,  I sit about 3 feet away from the mic, and with some tweaking in the \"Recording Devices\" manager in Windows, my friends are able to hear me loud and clear","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered two of these after finding out that the mic on a set of iPhone headphones would let me video chat with my grandkids (my internal mics are not working on my laptop), I have an HP Beats laptop (great internal speakers) and no place to connect a set of external speakers, not that it would fix the problem","positive":0},{"review":"  Basically does not work, I love the idea and size and whatnot, but I don't see the point of a mic this crappy","positive":0},{"review":"  I am going to give it 3 stars because the mismatch was my error, As I came to realize later, you need to go USB for good dictation quality","positive":0},{"review":"  Just plugged it in to my fifth test device, and it did not work again, Time and energy, as much as money","positive":0},{"review":"  My computer seems to have an issue recognizing the microphone and sees it as a headset instead of a microphone, Not working so going back","positive":0},{"review":"  My laptop had been giving bad feedback static through it's built-in microphone,Feel free to leave questions and I will gladly answer them","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing is total junk, which I suppose I shouldn't be surprised about given the price, Stay away","positive":0},{"review":"  UPDATE: Insten customer service *very promptly* replied to this review and has offered to replace the item free of charge, Very disappointed","positive":0},{"review":"  Ok, so I was really happy to find a Mic for so cheap and when it got here and improved the sound quality on my laptop, I was estatic,","positive":0},{"review":"  I was expecting something that had actually worked at volume level, and yet they hadn't mentioned that the sound is insanely low, meaning you will have to scream into the mic if you don't want to put your volume to 90% to even try to hear yourself,Hope this helps out someone to prevent purchasing the same mistake I did","positive":0},{"review":"  came with a cute horse shoe adapter to split out the headphone jack from a combo jack,  came with a cute horse shoe adapter to split out the headphone jack from a combo jack","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros:Insanely inexpensive, Did I mention it was a really good price","positive":1},{"review":"  My son has gone through a number of headset microphone combo sets with his gaming platform, Also, the cost of this headset   mic combo came in less then the commercially available combos of lesser quality","positive":1},{"review":"  i ordered this product to use with a tablet for recording lectures,  rosetta stone recognized what i was saying just fine some i'm guessing it doesn't pick up much","positive":1},{"review":"  I chose 4 stars because for a low priced microphone it works amazing and actually it works phenomenal for anything this priced, This is a very good mic, as i said before, it just screeches on high volume on my PC with tiny speakers","positive":1},{"review":"  I have  been using this item, No issues , small item  but works very well,","positive":1},{"review":"  I brought this microphone because I'm pretty cheap, Only wish the cord was just slightly longer and stronger but its nothing major","positive":1},{"review":"  as I speak on this microphone, I was able to get my audio that I needed, I did encounter a problem after words in my eqipment adn not get audio in skype, something with the connection of this mic interruped other icon or program but overall the mic works fine and I was able to keep it in my bag of toys, very nice to have it if I need a quickie video, I wish the quality sound would be a little beter but this is ok mic,","positive":1},{"review":"  Got an identical one from my university's electronics store of equal quality and comparable price ($<5)Needed it faster than Amazon could deliver, but it is nice to have a spare for a cheap microphone, It does the job to say it short and sweet","positive":1},{"review":"  It worked but not very well, If i would have known better I would have sent it back","positive":1},{"review":"  Edit: So after further use, I'm going to have to conclude that this is garbage, even for the 3 bucks I paid for it, Well, I'm sure you can use it on Skype like other people, I bought it to make some short blog videos, but I don't want to be awkwardly hunched forward while doing that so eh, I'll stick with the webcam mic","positive":0},{"review":"  If your looking for a cheap mic that works ok then look no further,I would recommend this product to people who will always be close to there PC and who are not looking for studio quality sound from this mic","positive":0},{"review":"  Do not believe these other reviews,75 inches so make sure the port is close enough to talk directly into","positive":0},{"review":"  It didn't work, Laptop didn't so much as detect an object was plugged in, let alone report a foreign device or work like a microphone","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this to do video recording responses to class assignments, Worked well for my class assignments, but I do wish that it was a bit longer so that I didn't have to bend over as much to speak into it for my voice to be heard","positive":0},{"review":"  Can`t use it, Can`t even tell if it works","positive":0},{"review":"  Rather dissapointing really, While it's cheap, I say save your money","positive":0},{"review":"  i got it to use while i recorded videos for school and well, its ok but its very selective on the audio it pics up, lets just say i ended up using me mic that was already in my laptop again, not too much money so no too upset, was made ok, does make a clicky sound when slightly hit against somthing like when your plugging it in, wouldent recomend it","positive":0},{"review":"  This microphone has poor sound quality and records best when the speaker is very close,I initially found this mic while searching for lecture microphones","positive":0},{"review":"  This product was completely unnecessary and unneeded, I thought it would allow clearer Microphone resolution in video calls or recording, but instead it is a useless paper weight collecting dust, I tried connecting it to my 3mm auxiliary port but nothing happened","positive":0},{"review":"  Only thing didn't care for is it tends to fall over but for the price its works great,","positive":1},{"review":"  This is not a stellar microphone, But it is the best microphone you can buy for the price, and if you need a cheap way to make a clean voice recording, you CANNOT find a better deal","positive":1},{"review":"  It is a good microphone for on the go when I can't take my full headset,  If you want something that sounds pretty good and gets the job done, this is it right here","positive":1},{"review":"  It receives the sound very well but we have 4 computers at home and it did not work on all of them, no idea why","positive":1},{"review":"  These work great in a motorcycle helmet connected to a GoPro, I've had one fail but, hey they are cheap and come from China","positive":1},{"review":"  We needed a very simple microphone b c my daughter wanted to do interactive stories on PBSkids, Sound seems fine","positive":1},{"review":"  Does what it says and it's cheap,","positive":1},{"review":"  I think that for what the product is, a plug in mic, it works fabulous, My 9 year old has messed with and my 2 year old so I am pretty confident that the product is durable :-) I would recommend this to a friend and i would definitely purchase it again in the future too","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is one of the best purchases I've made, For five bucks you won't find a better mic","positive":1},{"review":"  I actually liked this mic until I realized that this product produces a slight humming noise on the other side, But other than that, it's a pretty okay","positive":1},{"review":"  Wasn`t compatible with my laptop, Ended up donating it to goodwill","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price you pay - can't complain, it worked for a bit then fizzled out but helped us when Skyping from Europe to the USA, particularly in the beginning when we were working out the kinks on both ends of the Sypke product, We still keep it on hand for instances when those on the other end are having trouble hearing","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought it so I could use Cortana, but it still does not work,  So i give the microphone three stars and will continue to work on my problem","positive":0},{"review":"  Not impressed at all,I do NOT recommend people buying it, buy something else","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this microphone for my HP laptop to use while recording videos online, Unfortunately had to return the product and was promptly refunded","positive":0},{"review":"  I gave it two stars because it don't work well and its always in the way when I reaching over the lap top it always got caught under my sleeves, Its annoying no I would advise against buying this if you need to plug other devices to your laptop and you need to shuffle papers around or wearing a headset that's not wireless, which would get caught on the microphone extended arm","positive":0},{"review":"  but not good,Other than those problems, it's quite the nice microphone","positive":0},{"review":"  It performs for the most part as designed, however there is nothing in the design to keep the microphone standing upright, as it falls with the slightest movement,  But if this is the type of mic you want for your laptop, get this one, because it's the closest you're going to get to this type of design","positive":0},{"review":"  It may be my computer but when I insert the microphone into the mic jack I can no longer hear audio,","positive":0},{"review":"  Sadly it didnt fit into my headphones because its too thick, I did test it out another way and honestly, it wasnt even good","positive":0},{"review":"  great service, arrived very fast, The person on the other side had to turn their volume up all the way to make out what Im saying","positive":1},{"review":"  One of our laptops did not have an onboard mic, so Skype with audio and other things were not possible, Now both laptops have excellent recording capabilities","positive":1},{"review":"  Works well for my online testing purposes as well as recording conversations if necessary, I have not used it for Skype or video chatting but I have no doubt it would work just fine","positive":1},{"review":"  For what it is, it worked as intended, Looks great, works great","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this thing, My internal Mic was broken this Mic started working the moment I put it in","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this over a year ago, I totally recommend this","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this in hopes of expanding my ways of writing my book series by using Microsoft Word's talk-type process,  Sure, the quality is a little \"meh\" and one has to get pretty close to get it to recognize one's voice, but it's still a lot of fun and, for the price, I'd recommend it to anyone","positive":1},{"review":"  Good value for the price, Would get it again if it ever stops working","positive":1},{"review":"  Works as expected for an inexpensive microphone,  Now I can talk to a group of people gathered around the computer and hear them all equally well","positive":1},{"review":"  I payed 0, it falls down quickly","positive":0},{"review":"  Wish it was a tad longer, you also have to keep setting it up if you unplug it, However for the price it works perfect for occasional needs","positive":0},{"review":"  Got this hoping to be able to replace the mic on one of our Xbox headsets, didn't work for that purpose, seems in general the 3,5mm plug area is too stubby","positive":0},{"review":"  Terrible Product, I intend to send it back","positive":0},{"review":"  Not sure why I bought this, I later just bought a gaming headphone, The built-in laptop microphones are just as good id say","positive":0},{"review":"  Stopped working,  Stopped working","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this hoping it would replace the internal mic that my laptop has, many other bad things with this","positive":0},{"review":"  Did not work very well at all,  Worked very poorly with both","positive":0},{"review":"  Product is OK--what can you expect for this price, it fits standard socket very loosely, and the mike has to be taped in place to keep it from falling over","positive":0},{"review":"  My son is computer worthy but this did not work with his laptop,","positive":0},{"review":"  I have two 320GB ToughDrives which have performed reliably over several years, Recommended - a good product","positive":1},{"review":"  great little drive take it

anyone","positive":1},{"review":"  Very nice emergency radio,I'm not selling this thing but for $20 there's really no excuse not to get one","positive":1},{"review":"  It is a gamble when ordering these types of items online blindly, I have had a few various brand emergency radios in the past and some that were double this one's price and failed to meet my expectations, Very happy with this radio for the price you cannot beat it","positive":1},{"review":"  I was a bit surprised when I opened the package and found such a small compact radio that while still inside the box was a bit larger than the length of my hand, b) Use your vehicles battery, if you must charge your phone","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a nice, inexpensive little emergency radio flashlight,  This doesn't lessen my opinion of this item in any way, and actually it's kind of nice because I can fit in in the pocket of my cargo shorts","positive":1},{"review":"  The reception on this radio is exceptional on all three modes, AM FM Weather,  I have been using it in my basement where the reception is historically poor and the stations come in crystal clear","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a handy little thing to keep around in the event of an emergency, Overall, I'd revcomend this if you are in the market for a crank light radio","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this for hurricane-related emergencies in 2016,If you anticipate needing and emergency device like this that must actually work when you need it, I'd advise spending a bit more on something of better

the better battery and light setup","positive":0},{"review":"  Some of the functions on the radio do work, including the AM FM Weather radio and LED flashlight,If you're looking for a portable AM FM radio with weather band and don't need the Gimmicky flashlight and solar and hand-crank charging features, I'd highly recommend the Retekess PR15 radio as it is smaller and has better reception","positive":0},{"review":"  This worked great the very first day and I was very happy with it,  I'm not sure if it is just this one that is faulty since it had great reviews, but I would be willing to try another one","positive":0},{"review":"  This unit is cute, smart and well thought of,I will do more research and get something more substantial like a battery operated hand radio","positive":0},{"review":"  We had this little radio for about a year - mostly it was parked in a South-facing window of my house to keep the battery charged via the solar cells,  I'll be

impressed","positive":1},{"review":"  This device is really amazing,I'm almost hoping to have another blackout so I can try this out","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a really nice setup, For the price, you can't find anything else like this","positive":1},{"review":"  When I got this little radio in early 2017, I didn't pay too much attention to the cords supplied,  I loved what the radio did even before this generous customer service","positive":1},{"review":"  We had a  recent case of severe street flooding and we had to pull into a parking lot to shelter in place, I like that it's both solar and crank powered","positive":1},{"review":"  Not super powerful but effective and a good budget choice for light emergency use,  plus it is very light weight which makes it nice and portable and easy to grab quick, Tested the radio which was not super powerful but added a long piece of aluminum foil to the antenna and voila greatly expanded reception so should def be able to get any emergency broadcast updates if g*d forbid that is ever necessary and have a little light on hand no matter the conditions and a litte light is certainly better than no light if it ever comes to it","positive":1},{"review":"  Cranked for 5 minutes and got 1% of my battery charged on my phone,Just make sure you have a clear understanding on how to maintain these type of battery

upgraded version or a whole different brand","positive":0},{"review":"  I disliked that when I bought the product and tried it out, it seemed to work, but by the time I needed it, about two years

bracelet","positive":1},{"review":"  The Radio is great,  Recommend it highly","positive":1},{"review":"  What a fantastic product everyone should have at least two for use anywhere without electricity and doesn`t need batteries it has a hand crank that takes two seconds to charge it awesome product ,","positive":1},{"review":"  I was going to use it if we have a breakdown in our power supply, I thought it was bigger but it is fine","positive":1},{"review":"  always stays charged if in sunlight, not good for charging phones or anything else though","positive":1},{"review":"  great little radio, (10 inches)","positive":1},{"review":"  Didn't use it much before I stored it in our survival box,  I'm happy this far with the product","positive":1},{"review":"  This was the prefect gadget I was looking for in case for an emergency,  I'm very happy with my purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  Next to my hatchet, this is my favorite camping item, The only bad thing I can say about it that it's a bit bulky for a flashlight, and that it took me a while to find out how to charge the phone (it's the switch opposite of the SOS button on the bottom), but other than that, I love it","positive":1},{"review":"  Pretty cool, Coolest thing is the hide away antenna so is doesn't break easily","positive":1},{"review":"  I was willing to spend more on a sturdy, clean-lined and minimalist desktop stand,  Love it","positive":1},{"review":"  This monitor riser was easy to assemble, and it has a sleek and minimalistic look, It's glass so it gets smudges and shows dust easily, but wiping it off once a week keeps it fairly clean","positive":1},{"review":"  This is probably one of the best accessories for a desk, You can't go wrong with this purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  I was tired of messing with USB hubs that cluttered up my desk, I am very pleased with this product","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm an online college student and I have very little desk room to carry out my work,  This uboard is the way to go I am very happy with mine","positive":1},{"review":"  Was looking to update desktop for self and executives in the office, while hitting the ergonomic mark,  The mobile holder - eh, okay but again probably won't use","positive":1},{"review":"  I got the 'dumb' version without the USB or cup holder,  And yes, the logo on the top center front is tacky, but my TV covers it","positive":1},{"review":"  Upon buying this I was worried about the product I may receive with all the other reviews I read, I would and have recommended this item to others and people have asked me about it when they sat at my desk","positive":1},{"review":"  VERY nice stand, Very handy","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm currently working on building my music studio and needed a riser unit for my iMac,  It's innovative, and increases my desk space while looking good","positive":1},{"review":"  I love it as a stand for my 27\" iMac, Just don't attempt to charge anything valuable","positive":0},{"review":"  The product itself is decent, I did expect more for the money, You can do a lot better for $50","positive":0},{"review":"  nice quality and look,  Basically just for teacups or maybe cans which is not that practical","positive":0},{"review":"  When I purchased this item it was because in the description it stated that it has 3 usb port type 3,0 usb type ports","positive":0},{"review":"  The glass is very sturdy BUT the other pieces are very cheaply made, You would be much better off purchasing a normal riser and a USB to multi USB adapter","positive":0},{"review":"  Ok so this is definitely functional, About 3 inches of storage under it if you don't use it with the iMac","positive":0},{"review":"  None of the USB ports worked,  None of the USB ports worked","positive":0},{"review":"  worth the money,  worth the money","positive":0},{"review":"  Great design and functions as I expected, however, the USB ports do not work despite trying several different outlets and cables, \ud83d\ude21","positive":0},{"review":"  It's pretty good, I didn't test them out until recently and by now all the shipping materials have been recycled","positive":0},{"review":"  Only downside is that it's too short to use as a stand for a second monitor, So I'll still have to stack a couple of books on it to make the monitor stand taller","positive":1},{"review":"  The Headline says it all \"Great Product - Clean Design - Sturdy\", Fast shipping, friendly communications, and fair prices","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this as a present for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it, Lastly, I think the cupholder and phone holders are cute touches, but just get in the way for what he needs","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been using the UBOARD SMART for almost 3 months and it's great,  The side USB ports are also very useful and help me quickly set up my workspace with everything I need - I have a surface pro that I transfer between school and home frequently, and with the UBOARD's ports I can leave things like the a phone charger and the wireless keyboard dongle in place - very convenient","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this stand shelf to raise the height of my imac for a more ergonomic desk setup, although it isn't specifically made to do so, Jettisoned the cupholder which frankly seems a little silly but I do find the phone holder useful","positive":1},{"review":"  Easy to assemble, Makes it look more organized now","positive":1},{"review":"  It is exactly what i needed, It is very stable, clean and easy to assemble","positive":1},{"review":"  So beautiful everyone asks me about it,","positive":1},{"review":"  Needed a shelf about this width and about this depth to put my pc monitor on so i could slide my laptop under it, with the monitor and full size keyboard connected,  But nothing else would meet my needs and this perfect","positive":1},{"review":"  Does its job perfectly, and yes, it does have a logo on the top left corner, Love it and no complaints at all","positive":1},{"review":"  So to begin upon initially opening the box you will notice each item is to be assembled, Only purchase if you want it for the look, it serves no other purpose meaningfully","positive":0},{"review":"  Not what I expected, but made it work,","positive":0},{"review":"  The USB ports did not work,","positive":0},{"review":"  I love this stand, I`m disappointed","positive":0},{"review":"  You should ignore their stated weight specs, I definitely would not trust this product to support one","positive":0},{"review":"  Whilst looking at the description and pictures,one would assume that the words 'USB','Connectivity' and a picture of a USB stick in one of the ports would give some kind of connection,but so does a kebab on Saturday night at 3 am after a night out","positive":0},{"review":"  Ok, it's about $100 but its REALLY convenient, Definitely for people looking for extra office space","positive":0},{"review":"  Buon prodotto esteticamente, Comodissimo per tenere la scrivania del lavoro tutta bella ed in ordine","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my 27\" Thunderbolt Display but I am no where near comfortable putting this on there,It works much better for a laptop configuration and with the additional USB ports it even better","positive":0},{"review":"  Der Abstand zur Tatastur ist f\u00fcr mich zu gering,Die Verarbeitung ist jedenfalls OK, das Teil sieht schick aus","positive":0},{"review":"  Excellent quality, easy installation,","positive":1},{"review":"  I loved the U Board, it`s awesome and definitely helps save space, However, I would still recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to lift up my 27\" iMac,  I will have to test this one more","positive":1},{"review":"  After using this piece of furniture for close to a year, I am still very satisfied my purchase,I would strongly recommend this to someone who treasures functionality and aesthetics","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this riser for my Macbook Pro and absolutely love it, Other than wishing I have the option to place the cup holder more toward the front I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  This is great,  I would definitely recommend this item","positive":1},{"review":"  Good item, I've spilled a tall, glass cup of water when trying to use it","positive":1},{"review":"  Buy as many as you need,  You can spend less, and maybe when others see this it'll become a more popular style, but for now this stand is a standout","positive":1},{"review":"  For what I need it for which is putting my books on it so I can do HW in front of my computer it's great, Not sure if the USB works on mine but I don't even really use it","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm not using it as a monitor stand, but it would certainly work well as such,  It was easy to put together and it's nice to have the phone holder attachment","positive":1},{"review":"  This worked perfectly - I have an All-in-one HP Envy23, I haven't used the USB feature on it, but I do use the holder for my phone - keeps it handy","positive":1},{"review":"  Great sleek design, I haven't found much use for the cup holder because I usually drink out of ware bottles but the 3 extra ports have been very useful","positive":1},{"review":"  This has been holding up my 20\" monitor for eons now, no bowing, I just put photos in it, and put a pen cup in the cup holder","positive":1},{"review":"  Received mine and was ablw to assemble within eight minutes of opening the box, Pieces felt VERY sturdy together even before putting the screws in","positive":1},{"review":"  Shipped on time as expected, Very happy","positive":1},{"review":"  Great aesthetic and holds well,  Great aesthetic and holds well","positive":1},{"review":"  This tempered glass platform is perfect for using a graphics tablet,)Great item","positive":1},{"review":"  Thank you, this is really clean, transparent, I loved it, except the legs, I used others in white color,","positive":1},{"review":"  Nicer that I thought, my mac mini can be placed below, and my blue ray without problem, it has a USB 2,and my moitor is wide but not very tall","positive":1},{"review":"  Goes great together with the Skycrane CC full version, That will make it a real easy flip between CB, TV and weatherband frequencies","positive":1},{"review":"  Received today, Thanks for a great weather radio","positive":1},{"review":"  Solar powered, hand crank, and battery powered, I am very pleased with this item","positive":1},{"review":"  I have used this now for several camping seasons, I store and transport the radio in the original box so the original styrofoam (which I made the base from) all fits back in the box","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a solid, well-designed little radio, If you want one, purchase any adapter with the following specifications:  - 5V, providing at least 300mA DC output  - Negative tip polarityEnjoy","positive":1},{"review":"  I like the CC Solar Observer Radio, but I was fooled by Amazon's packaging into buying a \"xuuyuu\" non-CCrane ac adapter -- there is a \"people also bought X\" with this item section,  It was a pleasure to have my problem solved","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall I'm very happy with this product,  I will be buying at least one more since we live in an area that has power outages very often all winter long","positive":1},{"review":"  What could be easier than just letting it sit in the sun to charge, But I don't think I'll bother to buy one","positive":1},{"review":"  I was very excited to try this radio out based off online reading and reviews, Very impressive little handheld radio","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio is very well-made, and picks up stations from all over the place at night, I expect it to be in use for many years to come","positive":1},{"review":"  As the owner of a C,  The usual caveats apply: it'd be better if it were smaller and lighter","positive":1},{"review":"  other hand-crank dynamo radios are reported to feel cheap, Its made in china","positive":1},{"review":"  Great, loud and clear","positive":1},{"review":"  The radio performance is ok, but dynamo (cranking) or solar panel charging are a joke,  You can get a good portable radio of another brand for the cost of the C Crane replacement battery","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this radio in 2013 for a bug-out bag and emergency use, Find a different radio","positive":0},{"review":"  If I didn't live off the grid I wouldn't buy this radio, Guaranteed this will happen to anyone who really uses this radio","positive":0},{"review":"  Had the first one replaced within the first few months because it just stopped working, Looks like I will have buy a name brand model","positive":0},{"review":"  To be fair,  I guess, the search goes on","positive":0},{"review":"  Let me start by saying I have purchased 4 LED flashlights,  2- 1 4 speed cassette radios from C,IF none of these things matter to you then this is the radio for you","positive":0},{"review":"  Useful and Functional, I overpaid for this emergency radio","positive":0},{"review":"  I liked it while it worked,  Very disappointing for the price","positive":0},{"review":"  I was hoping for more for the price, Which I haven't tried yet","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this to use while camping,  What a complete piece of crap","positive":0},{"review":"  Very, very nifty radio,The one thing you have to be careful of is the on off switch, and switch for the light display are very easily slid into the on position if you have this device packed in with other equipment where shifting load can cause these switches to be turned on","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the 6th one of these we have purchased as gifts,  Now I have an extra one to give to someone else","positive":1},{"review":"  I've never had a less than stellar product from C Crane Co, Thanks again C Crane & Amazon","positive":1},{"review":"  We use the C Crane Solar Observer as a home emergency radio, Just remember not to use the bullt in flashight or dial backlight as both use a lot of power","positive":1},{"review":"  Glad they kept true to this radio over the years, he would like it","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to listen to talk and sports while working outside, in addition to possible emergency use,Again, an emergency radio, to be used in the dark or outdoors in the sun (and wind), should have a stable base","positive":1},{"review":"  This was bought for a camp radio,  No problems hearing it and it pulls the stations in to my satisfaction","positive":1},{"review":"  After owning four Kaito KA 500 Solar Radios, this radio excels in many ways,","positive":1},{"review":"  I have only had my CC Observer for about a week but  I am pretty happy with it so far,All in all it's a decent little radio for the price and what it is designed for","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best of the best--can't recommend it highly enough,  Highly recommended","positive":1},{"review":"  Not so happy with this, Crank works well and the sound is excellent but I would not recommend this model","positive":0},{"review":"  A quality radio with good reception and surprisingly clear sound,  In conclusion, I like the construction quality, style and design, but the limited power capability of the tiny solar collector make it a non-starter for me","positive":0},{"review":"  This is the first C Crane product I have purchased with which I am dissatisfied - and in this case, deeply disappointed,","positive":0},{"review":"  The radio I received did not work,What I got was a non working radio and restock charges","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this based on all the 5-star reviews, but was disappointed,  I will be sending it back and will search for something that actually works","positive":0},{"review":"  Fm is good, but AM which is what I listen to is not even as good as some of my cheap AM radios , if you need a good AM radio I do not recommend this radio","positive":0},{"review":"  I had heard good things about C Craine, and so I purchased this product,  Hopefully this time I will get a \"Made in China,\" product that works","positive":0},{"review":"  Somewhat disappointed based on the usual superior products from C,) The handcrank function works well but your arm gets really tired","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this to replace the slightly older dynamo model, Oddly, when I make sudden movements, the signal fades or you hear loud static crackle, step away and it works again","positive":0},{"review":"  This radio did not include a power cord with it, and the one I bought for it didn't work,","positive":0},{"review":"  Dropped another portable radio and the AM reception failed,  Ordered an Adapter","positive":1},{"review":"  All mechanical design which is elegantly simple to use-excellent AM FM reception with outstanding tone and plenty of volume , in our area the weather band provides  6 of the 7 stations , and with the choice of:  AAA batteries, the internal rechargeable pack, the solar charger and the dynamo I am certain that regardless of the duration of a utility power outage we will be well served by this little gem which has NO alert feature at all, exactly the way we want it,Amazon comes through again-quick delivery of a brand new, never been opened before product in absolutely perfect pristine condition and of course at an excellent price","positive":1},{"review":"  This is by far the best radio I've ever had, I can't tell how awesome this radio is","positive":1},{"review":"  I first puchased the Kaito Voyager Pro twice--then returned it twice due to poor quality,  That makes it even better","positive":1},{"review":"  Small, can crank use solar or ac adapter or AA batteriesComes with rechargeable battery pack,Has a flashlight and phone charger too","positive":1},{"review":"  My former radio was an Eton fr600b but it went down an ice hole, The sound quality, 30 dollar lower price tag,  and improved reception pretty much trump the negatives of this radio however and I'm happy with my purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  C Crane radios are hard to beat, This is my third, all of them different from shortwave to table-top","positive":1},{"review":"  Cant find fault with this, Again, far better that the Eton","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio is awesome, Get the charger and extra battery because why not","positive":1},{"review":"  Despite several attempts, I just couldn't get the radio to hold a charge beyond a few minutes, tops, Perhaps not an issue for others","positive":0},{"review":"  Although I'm happy with the C Crane radio,  I'm disappointed they do not including a power supply with the radio, Purchase a power supply separately that was shown on Amazon to be an optional accessory for this radio and  after waiting a long time for it to arrive, the plug does not match the jack on the radio","positive":0},{"review":"  Not rugged, poor sound, poor flashlight, unreliable,Stopped working unexpectedly","positive":0},{"review":"  After a lot of storms and power outages over the past year, we wanted to get a good weather radio, We will probably just end up buying another one soon, probably a different brand, though","positive":0},{"review":"  I read in earlier reviews that the hand crank appeared to be flimsy and looked felt cheap,I was surprised it happened, but it did, and Amazon stepped right up and accepted my return with no issues","positive":0},{"review":"  I have a Kaito Voyager that I wanted to replace because the reception is not too good, Because of this I don't now recommend","positive":0},{"review":"  Flimsy plastic casing doesn't feel very rugged,  For the price, I feel like more bells and whistles could've been included","positive":0},{"review":"  did not get AM at all and cut on and off sent back, I bought 2 and the other one work ok the AM is still not good but it's ok","positive":0},{"review":"  The item arrived quickly and in good condition, Overall, it was a good purchase","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this radio in February and it quit working in June with limited use, Very disappointed","positive":0},{"review":"  I was given this radio by my brother as I live in tornado alley, Stay safe","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent radio with multiple ways to power, Crane Radio may come in handy one day","positive":1},{"review":"  Lightweight, good reception, Highly recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  I don't have much to add but I thought the radio deserved a higher average rating,  Nice design but I expected more quality for the price","positive":1},{"review":"  I just received this solar radio and am impressed by its capabilities and versatilities for emergency purposes,  Overall, for the value, this is a great, portable Solar radio","positive":1},{"review":"  I use portable radios a lot, sometimes outside for 6-8 hours at a stretch, primarily AM talk radio and news stations,  This is one of the best","positive":1},{"review":"  I owned two Eton dynamo-type radios that were quite good, but eventually (after about 5 years) they wore out,  I am generally considered to be fussy about the quality of electronic devices, and I am completely satisfied with this one","positive":1},{"review":"  Much to my surprise, the solar charger feature actually works, I wish it came with the A C cord though","positive":1},{"review":"  We listen to the radio a lot, I have been enjoying the radio everyday since I received it","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this radio primarily for AM reception, I'm very pleased with this excellent radio","positive":1},{"review":"  did not come with 5volt charger , Does not store sun energy as expected","positive":0},{"review":"  Could be me, could be the lot, or maybe the handling-only worked for the first hour and half of use, Bad luck I guess","positive":0},{"review":"  The solar power function is almost useless,  Controls excellent","positive":0},{"review":"  I live in a flat area about 20 miles from the weather band tower,UPDATE:  I bought a different but similar radio and had no problems receiving the weather station","positive":0},{"review":"  For this kind of $ it should be MADE IN USA,  For this kind of $ it should be MADE IN USA","positive":0},{"review":"  It's all right after listening to all the CC cream advertisements on the radio not overly impressed not underly impressed either could have got the same thing made in China a lot cheaper It's Made in China 2,  It's all right after listening to all the CC cream advertisements on the radio not overly impressed not underly impressed either could have got the same thing made in China a lot cheaper It's Made in China 2","positive":0},{"review":"  Pros:The radio reception is good in AM and FM, For the price of this radio and the descent sound and reception it is good to have","positive":0},{"review":"  It does not hold the charge and it's necessary to constantly wind it up, Okay for an emergency","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought 4 of these 2 years ago with good AM FM and battery experiences,","positive":0},{"review":"  The Idea behind this radio is great, I loved the fact you can have 4 different power sources,  I would think I got one of the few lemons that make it through QC","positive":0},{"review":"  Full disclosure: I'm an idiot, I'm typing from my laptop now","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop sleeve is very well made, as other reviewers have pointed out, Thank you","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this sleeve for my 13in MacBook Pro,Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable, slim-fitting sleeve for your MacBook Pro","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a Lenovo X1 Carbon 6th Gen, which is a 14\" laptop,3\" version despite the fact that it was still a little loose, and hopefully this one

fulfilled my expectations for a sleeve","positive":1},{"review":"  So far so good, Overall, I recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  Soft stretchy material, Overall, very happy with purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is amazing and has saved my laptop on more than one occasion, The quality is truly outstanding","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my Surface Pro 6, and it fits perfectly, even with the pen stuck to the side,  I'm pretty sure a fall of farther than a few inches won't end well, but this is padded enough that I'm not worried about my toy getting scratched up in my backpack","positive":1},{"review":"  Super happy with this purchase,  You know I am","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this laptop case because I really liked the shade of pink offered by this company,  I`m very disappointed and will be returning this item","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laptop bag about 3 months ago, Do yourself, and your pocket, a favor and look somewhere else for your laptop bag needs","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered the 13\" for the new MBP touch bar and was hoping for a similar fit to the 2010 InCase MBP neoprene sleeve,A less important annoyance is that the perimeter is a snug fit, but the fabric hem right inside of the zipper does not protrude much either, so it's difficult to zip up without rubbing the computer against the zipper","positive":0},{"review":"  OK, this was supposed to be the 13-13, will return immediately","positive":0},{"review":"  This review is about the baby pink version, Buyer beware, at least for the baby pink version","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought the gray case and it stains super easy,  While I must say these look like fantastic cases - the quality of the zipper and plush inside are really nice, the quality of the materials are quickly overshadowed by how easily this get stained","positive":0},{"review":"  I was very disappointed upon receiving this product, At $13, it's barely worth the hassle of returning, and I'm weary of wasting my money on another one","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0Pros:Though I haven't tested it (only an idiot would), this looks fairly water resistant, Pass and pay a few more $$$ to go a step up","positive":0},{"review":"  THIS CASE IS NOT WATER REPELLENT, Don`t waste your money","positive":0},{"review":"  I`m very disappointed with this product, I will return the product if the smell doesn`t improve after five days, because I definitely don`t want the smell to transfer to the inside of my bag","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price, this case (with its accompanying pouch for accessories) is a real buy,  I would definitely buy this again if the need arose","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this whole all of the stores

and it didnt even do that","positive":0},{"review":"  The inside lining is extremely soft and I love that it came with a second, smaller pouch, but the 13 is much too big for the Macbook Air 13, Would`ve loved to keep as the color is beautiful, but had to return due to sizing","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop protector DOES NOT fit my 15 MacBook Pro like the description states, Unfair

different sleeve and will trash this one once the new one delivers and I only had it a few short weeks","positive":0},{"review":"  I got the size for a 12\" Macbook, It also stains easily, but I'm not

iron, but my cat threw up on it and I just didn't want to deal with cleaning it,  It's very soft inside, so it doesn't do any harm","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn`t see many reviews for this with photos regarding the Surface 2 Laptop, Soft on the inside, thin yet still sturdy, overall good purchase and would recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great laptop sleeve, I haven't tested out how water repellent it is yet, and I don't want to risk it","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my Surface Pro 3, Either way quality product","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a new Macbook owner and purchased this product before even getting my Macbook to make sure it would be fully protected, I travel a lot and I made the decision to return this product on the basis that if my computer was dropped while inside it, I don't think it would offer much protection","positive":1},{"review":"  Water repellent would be false advertising, The pictures i posted were after 10 minutes of blow drying on heat and it looks bad and did not absorb much of the drink","positive":0},{"review":"  This does not fit a 2020 MacBook Pro model A2289, In the case of this sleeve, there is significant bunching on the top and bottom when the MacBook is inside","positive":0},{"review":"  At first, I was super hyped when I bought this since I've been meaning to get a laptop carrier since my old one was too beat up after years of using it,If you want my advice, this product really isn't worth buying unless you're content with having it broken and unusable not even after a year of buying it","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this for my daughter's school mac book,  Now I have to go buy a new case, though certainly I will be choosing a different brand","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a nice product, It shows a lot of dirt already from just going in my car and around","positive":0},{"review":"  I am not one to normally write reviews, but I always look at them before I make a purchase, I just wish it was what I was anticipating","positive":0},{"review":"  I put my surface laptop 3 13 inch inside the case and I go to school, then after a couple of hours when I need it, I take it out, I won't use the case again because I don 't want to laptop to keep burning, which can cause permanent damage","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop case was advertised as fitting the Surface Book 2, Does not inspire confidence in durability or protectivity","positive":0},{"review":"  It was pouring rain sideways this morning and my book bag got soaked and the case got wet, I pulled out my macbook and it was damp and case wet inside,  It is also larger than the macbook it moves around in the case","positive":0},{"review":"  I have had this laptop sleeve (wine-colored) for one year,This is also a minor pet peeve of mine, but the zippers are not covered by rubber or anything, so anytime you move the laptop sleeve across a tabletop, the zippers drag and make loud noises","positive":0},{"review":"  Sleeve feels well-made and zippers work as expected, Product has held up for the first six months of daily university use with no signs of wear","positive":1},{"review":"  So, this has been on a few trips, As far as cleaning, I wait until I have a few days between travel and clean it with dish soap and let it air dry","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve had this cover for a year and I`ve had to buy a new one recently, On the plus side though the little extra cover for the charging cord was actually VERY useful for keeping it in one place and easy to wrap the cord up to take to classes","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a Macbook air 13' and for the past 4-5 years had a laptop case I liked fine,Overall, I think it was a good buy and hopefully will last me for a while","positive":1},{"review":"  Only had a few days but I like it for what it is, Will update my review as it gets used this holiday season of travel","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for a sleeve for my MISTI,  I wish there were more colors available in the size I needed but I am very happy with the product","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered the case specifically for MacBooks and I'm so glad I did, It also did me well for my freshman year of college and I have no doubt it will do the same","positive":1},{"review":"  It fits my Lenovo Ideapad perfectly and my charger also fits in the smaller sleeve with no issues,I would have liked the material on the outside of the sleeve to be a little thicker but the important part is it provides basic protection for my laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this set as I was entering Grad school and wanted to ensure I took good care of my Mac, Overall, makes me wanna buy for my friends who are living their lives on the Wildside by just putting their laptops anywhere","positive":1},{"review":"  Roomy, Considering the low price, I don't mind","positive":1},{"review":"  You read the title, Spending twenty more on your cover will be the difference between buying a new macbook or simply cleaning the dust off your durable, dependable cover","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought for my daughter to use for her school laptop,  It is a nice thickness and has good protection while laptop is in her backpack, but next time will go for a darker color as it does not clean easily","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my 12\" MacBook based on the review and product description, Never recommend","positive":0},{"review":"  I was so excited to get this sleeve within 24hrs that I didn`t read the reviews mentioning water stains, But because it`s not water proof and I need it tomorrow, I stick it in the dryer for 25 minutes, where not only has the water stain moved, but now the zippers have left marks all over the sides of the sleeve","positive":0},{"review":"  VERY disappointed on sizing of this, Quilty and function are simply okay but expected a much better fit than what was advertised","positive":0},{"review":"  This (Mosiso) is much less expensive than the Incase brand neoprene sleeve,  You need some protection - this provides none, except possibly for dampness","positive":0},{"review":"  I should give it a 2 star, but given it's price I guess it's value for the money,","positive":0},{"review":"  The case is nice but it is larger than my MacBook Air 13, Thank you","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this case for it's simplicity and cushion, Just be careful","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this product for my new MacBook, Would I buy this again for another computer, probably not","positive":0},{"review":"  Ordered this because I live in Florida and you never know what hurricane season is going to bring,  I hope we dont get any hurricanes but at least I am prepared","positive":1},{"review":"  The radio is easy to get set up, and hope my cell signal is operational at that time","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased this because I really thought we were going to be in complete lock down here in the USA, It`s cool to have","positive":1},{"review":"  I`m so happy to able to have this radio,I live in Florida so this radio its going to be so helpful during the hurac\u00e1n season","positive":1},{"review":"  Just got it,  Hope I don't need it, but it's comforting to know I have it","positive":1},{"review":"  Works great, It was already tuned to my local weather","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice size,  Nice size","positive":1},{"review":"  Product worked really well,  I would highly suggest it be purchased for one of those unexpected emergency","positive":1},{"review":"  Loved that it can be used with AAA batteries, rechargeable lithium battery or solar,","positive":1},{"review":"  Very good to have, It works well","positive":1},{"review":"  I now suspect this product was already returned as defective, as stops working after 10-15 minutes, whether indoors or out and on any power source, So far, very happy with this purchase","positive":0},{"review":"  The radio and flashlight work, but the marginal quality is apparent all over, It looks and feels like Dollar General or Big Lots, and I wouldn't count on it in an emergency","positive":0},{"review":"  El equipo es muy bonito y ser\u00eda m\u00e1s si funcionara correctamente, funcion\u00f3 un rato ( 30 minutos) despu\u00e9s dej\u00f3 de escucharse la peque\u00f1a bocina y solo se escucha si se utilizan aud\u00edfonos, adem\u00e1s trae algunas ralladuras,  El equipo es muy bonito y ser\u00eda m\u00e1s si funcionara correctamente, funcion\u00f3 un rato ( 30 minutos) despu\u00e9s dej\u00f3 de escucharse la peque\u00f1a bocina y solo se escucha si se utilizan aud\u00edfonos, adem\u00e1s trae algunas ralladuras","positive":0},{"review":"  Like the size of the radio, Casing seems a bit fragile if taken outdoors","positive":1},{"review":"  I like the fact that the radio is small, has more than one source of power, and the sound is good, I would recommend this product to have in cases of emergencies","positive":1},{"review":"  Seems to work well,","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this little radio,","positive":1},{"review":"  Great little radio and it has everything you need on it,","positive":1},{"review":"  Its compact and easy to store in a back pack, And it is easy to use","positive":1},{"review":"  It is easy to use and the sound is wonderful,","positive":1},{"review":"  Radio works great,  Radio works great","positive":1},{"review":"  I already owned a couple of emergency radios, but this little guy had some features my others didn't,All in all, this emergency radio is a pip - if you don't already have an emergency radio, don't hesitate to get one of these","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my 3rd radio of this type, and it's not a bad one, Time will tell on that one","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0> Portable and lightweight, I get 0% mobile phone or TV antenna signal at all in my basement, so for it to get 97% means it is super powerful","positive":1},{"review":"  I thought I took pictures of this before I put it away in the emergency box but unfortunately I cannot find them, I absolutely love this little radio beacon   flashlight charger","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great sized little emergency radio, Still, the rest of it seems so good, fingers crossed, this is a good unit","positive":1},{"review":"  What did I use it for, I will update this review if my opinion changes","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a nice little emergency radio flashlight,Using all three different radio bands, I didn't even have to extend the antenna to get most stations to come in, but it's nice that it's there in case we run into bad reception","positive":1},{"review":"  Regardless of where you live everyone needs one of these radios,If you are looking for an emergency radio you could do al ot worse then this one","positive":1},{"review":"  Everyone should have some kind of emergency radio at home for events that may happen, If not, think about something like this little number","positive":1},{"review":"  This is what is always needed in areas where disasters like earthquakes can occur,  Overall, this is a truly smart emergency tool that I highly recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0What I like most about this radio is you can power it 4 ways (hand crank, solar, AAA batteries (3), USB) and it has the NOAA weather band,This is a must have for your bug out bag, vehicle or RV","positive":1},{"review":"  Sometimes great engineering design comes in a very small package,  And smile","positive":1},{"review":"  A must have for any emergencies,Overall, an excellent addition to an emergency kit at a great price","positive":1},{"review":"  I wanted an emergency radio that if I forgot until I needed it down the road, I knew would be ready to work regardless of whether I had fresh batteries,  I am very satisfied","positive":1},{"review":"  The light on my old hand crank no longer stayed on any longer than a second or so after you stopped cranking the handle so I thought it was time to replace it,  This one is hooked to my go-bag","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio is powered in so many ways, This is great for an emergency kit, bug out bag, to take camping, or have around the house","positive":1},{"review":"  This crank radio is perfect for our disaster hurricane apocalypse kit, A welcome addition to our kit","positive":1},{"review":"  This crank radio is small and compact but it has so many features,  Small enough to put in a backpack, purse or glove box in your car","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great little emergency device, And, the kinetic charge also works well as a backup for charging the battery","positive":1},{"review":"  I live in FL and have had my fair share of hurricanes and never had an emergency radio, because by the time I'm thinking of getting one during hurricane season, I can't find one, It is really easy to use and a great thing to have on hand","positive":1},{"review":"  Offers a lot in a small package,Overall well made and flexible","positive":1},{"review":"  I got my first one 3 years ago, But the charge lasts a long time","positive":1},{"review":"  I just came in from outside having used this speaker and wanted to recall when I bought it,Having written this, it might just be time to for me concede this is \"the one\" and stop looking for a replacement","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this at a discount on Today's Deal hoping to solve a problem with noise on my patio,  It is of good quality, I enjoy using it, and it meets minimum geekiness standards","positive":1},{"review":"  I've really enjoyed having this,  But if you pause the music on your phone for a few seconds and then start it again, the problem seems to go away, so this could be an issue with the phone as much as with the speaker","positive":1},{"review":"  My wife won a Jawbone Big Jambox a few years ago and turned me onto the greatness of the wireless Bluetooth speaker, It is designed to be an inexpensive, versatile, rugged, portable speaker for folks on the go, and it fits that description quite well","positive":1},{"review":"  Works very well, very good quality,Unless you're looking for very loud, this product is probably exactly what you want","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased my first Rukus  July 2014 for camping,  Buy this product and you will not be disappointed unless your an adolescent child who is insistent on Complaining about everything","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased this one day when it was a lightning deal and I'm so glad I did, In addition, there is a place for an aux cord just in case you are hooking up something that doesn't have bluetooth","positive":1},{"review":"  Really happy with this product,  5 stars","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to use on the dashboard of a Postal delivery truck,  This Rugged Rukas is terrific","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve had the rugged ruckus a few months now, I`m actually really disappointed, as I love the idea of not having to plug in a Bluetooth speaker, but the downsides to this one outweigh having to find an outlet","positive":0},{"review":"  While this thing worked it was great,On the other hand, the BT radio and battery still work, so I guess it has that going for it","positive":0},{"review":"  I WANT to love this speaker,  From here, I'll have to give up on this speaker, and search for something more reliable","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this device a couple of Falls ago when I was working at a remote wilderness camp, While it could use some improvement, it is a functional asset to have in the wilderness","positive":0},{"review":"  When I bought this unit in April 2018, I was looking forward to using this for camping, Not worth the money","positive":0},{"review":"  Change of heart, Good luck peeps","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased my first Rukus in 2014, Net, the 2014 model was awesome and indestructible, the 2016  & 2017 models are not","positive":0},{"review":"  I figured that Eton has been making innovatively powered radios and flashlights for years and so this speaker should be great,  I believe this device to be unsuitable for even that level of atmospheric moisture","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted to like this, but the quality just isn't there for the price,  Eton replaced it with a new unit (took about a month), the new unit started having the same problem after a couple of months","positive":0},{"review":"  This is my 2nd Rugged Rukus, Not as seamless at the original","positive":0},{"review":"  Was skeptical when ordering, but product delivers,  Its so versatile and compact, why not","positive":1},{"review":"  I got a chance to really test this out a week after I purchased it, Granted I was at a place with ample amounts of sun each day and during that time I don't think the battery charge dropped more than two light on the indicator, It will be interesting to see how it does if there's an overcast  cloudy day","positive":1},{"review":"  This speaker works very well overall,  Most things probably would have busted from the drop","positive":1},{"review":"  I use a Samsung mp3 player to listen to audiobooks while driving, After a month of use, I give the rukon 5 stars for good volume and running for 18 hours without need for additional charging by USB","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this little speaker for over 2 years and have nothing but praises for it,I wasn't paid for this review but sure wish I was","positive":1},{"review":"  I have to admit, I wasn't thrilled with this product at first, We compared it to a friend's Bose Bluetooth speaker and couldn't hear much of a difference","positive":1},{"review":"  my husband is a lineman he works in the bucket all day and he loves his music we have been through multiple speakers and his phone is dead by the end of the day,","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this specifically for a trip to the beach to play music from my phone and keep it charged,  Connects easily to my phone and is simple to use","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the second one I have purchased and I couldn't be happier, This is my go to speaker for camping - I would highly recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  The best solar anything ever,  Carried it on the back of my pack on the Appalachian Trail for 5 months and is still going strong","positive":1},{"review":"  Rugged Rukus used to make great speakers, It's a shame that a company with such a vision and an incredible product decided they would rather sell out with cheaply made garbage sold by the truckload than continue with the high-quality speakers they were initially making, even if the cost was a bit more","positive":0},{"review":"  UPDATE: charging issues,Overall, great product ETON","positive":0},{"review":"  The Eton speaker lasted for quite a few years, 2) the charging port is not very secure and broke internally after a while so it became unusable","positive":0},{"review":"  I had one of the original first generation rugged ruckus and it is still kicking, charging phones and playing music all day rain or shine,$150 of wasted money","positive":0},{"review":"  I like this speaker,  I just don`t know how they could overlook such an easy thing","positive":0},{"review":"  Been through two of these and they just don't last, So they offer a prorated cash offer which I took to purchase another speaker","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought one of these over 7 years ago and it worked very well,  I would even pay more to get one that works but what the heck, I give up","positive":0},{"review":"  Loved it at first,Hopefully Customer Support will contact me here and help","positive":0},{"review":"  I let this unit charge all day and then took it out on the road with me, I'm returning it for a refund","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this for camping and was pretty disappointed, I will be returning the second one as well and getting something different","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing works great for playing music outside in a quiet environment,  I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a portable speaker solution for camping or other recreational activities","positive":1},{"review":"  I had a very hard time picking a bluetooth speaker system,You will not be disappointing in this little guy as long as you don't go watch all the youtube videos that say it has good bass, because a cheep pair of head phones will produce more bass than this speaker","positive":1},{"review":"  This speaker is great,  This could probably be solved with a reset, but it doesn't seem to have a reset button","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this,  He had his first one for years until it got lost","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this specifically for my deployment, To be fair, our trucks aren't exactly quiet, but even when I have it at the gym or in my barracks, it's just not as loud as other soldiers' speakers","positive":1},{"review":"  It has a sturdy feel,  Dont give Eton your money twice if they play that game","positive":1},{"review":"  me and all my friends love it,I was surprised at how long it can play on a single charge and how loud it can play music","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing has been awesome so far,Overall great buy and I will update my review once I've been using it for a few months","positive":1},{"review":"  My review is slightly price sensitive considering I got this on a lightning deal,Battery life, sound, solar capability, usb charging port for additional devices, and functions of this bluetooth speaker make it worth taking a chance on something other than the BIG brands,  I have had it for almost a year and havent had any complaints, i actually recommend it all the time","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the second of these I've bought, We got tired of running back and forth with it so now we have two to keep around","positive":1},{"review":"  Why not 5 stars: Only complaint is : I would expect the ac port to be next to the on button and not the aux port, The manual has information but it is not friendly","positive":0},{"review":"  So while the solar charging is awesome, the sound quality was decent and loud enough,Get it for a solar charger, don't expect it to live as anything but","positive":0},{"review":"  We purchased this solar powered speaker to use on the beach during the vacation, Thanks Amazon","positive":0},{"review":"  tl, We took it to a music festival, and it was dead within an hour, and the sun charging only seemed to give it 30 minutes of juice at a time","positive":0},{"review":"  It sounds great, Not worth the money","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this product because it was highly recommended by one of my favorite youtuber reviewer,Conclusion: great concept, but poor build quality","positive":0},{"review":"  Junk compared to the rugged rukus thats only $50, Basically a paper weight now","positive":0},{"review":"  I have had the rugged rukus for more than 1,  what good is a battery speaker if you can not charge it","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this speaker as the prime of the day at a great price, Overall I have found cheaper speakers with better sound quality, but if your looking for the connivence of solar power I recommend it","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this last summer and when I got it out this weekend it no longer works, I expected to get more than one summer out of this speaker","positive":0},{"review":"  I love this thing so much I feel like we're in a relationship,","positive":1},{"review":"  Love these, Goes dead if you are charging and listening to music but if it's a sunny day it will play music all day and keep a charge","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an excellent speaker, I will most likely buy another one of these as a Father's Day gift for my dad","positive":1},{"review":"  bought this for a camping trip, It'll be following me along on more outdoor trips","positive":1},{"review":"  I was in love with this product when it first arrived (October 2013),","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this for three years,  I almost took off a star for this but everything else is great and would certainly get again or recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this after seeing a friend use one and being really impressed with the sound quality, Highly recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this a year ago for a trip to the beach, I think this thing is just incredible","positive":1},{"review":"  My original review was that this speaker was complete crap to order as a gift and receive damaged item, But other than that - this is an awesome speaker at an excellent price","positive":1},{"review":"  It's small, not very heavy, I'm curious what the more expensive model is like","positive":1},{"review":"  NOT REALLY RUGGED AFTERALL, Before it died, the up volume button stopped working too","positive":0},{"review":"  Update: nothing like the old one, We are ordering him a new one for Fathers Day because he doesn`t know what to do without it","positive":0},{"review":"  It only charges 3 of the 4 bars on sunlight during the full day and that only charges my iphone 5c about 25%, Not a very great solar charging system though","positive":0},{"review":"  Had it a year and died,","positive":0},{"review":"  It worked well for a little while, Pairs with devices and plays music very faintly, not even audible if your ear is not pressed against it","positive":0},{"review":"  Absolute junk, Great concept, but this speaker is far too quiet (In fact, models half this price beat the sound quality and volume of this unit)additionally, it died pretty quickly after purchase and stopped charging","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased 2 of these for two of my sons for Christmas, Other than that they love their Rukus","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had my Rukus for over a year now,  Seems like a lot of money for it to not last longer","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this unit for the waterproof properties and the range posted in the information,","positive":0},{"review":"  The product worked satisfactorily, though the volume was not very loud,  I attempted to contact ETON 3x while still under warranty with no response","positive":0},{"review":"  I just received the radio a few days ago and truly cannot give a rating on performance, however, Is was definitely disappointed the radio did not come with Li-ion batteries,Also, the radio does have a reading light which is under the solar cells, but the instructions do not tell one how to find it","positive":1},{"review":"  This was exactly what I was looking for and it was even more compact than I expected, Perfect for emergency prep kits","positive":1},{"review":"  Love it, Exactly what I was looking for","positive":1},{"review":"  Works as described,  Works as described","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product, would definitely recommend,","positive":1},{"review":"  Unfortunately the crank didn`t work on the unit and I was super excited to see that in action, It seemed well made but as I said the crank didn`t work","positive":0},{"review":"  This comes in handy when the power goes out,","positive":0},{"review":"  Just received radio in mail,  Lithium is the way to go with this radio","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice lil pocket radio but was very disappointed when i realized the Amazon listing for this item is wrong, Liked it but did not neet my needs due to incorrect specs listed","positive":1},{"review":"  NICE,better can be  had, but this is pretty good- and at this price, a bargan","positive":1},{"review":"  This review is for the Mini Compact,  I've learned as a result to to not connect headphones until after turning the radio on, and then slowly, slowly adjusting the volume up","positive":1},{"review":"  The Grundig Edition Mini AM FM & Shortwave portable radio has one of the slimmest profiles I have seen  Does this black beauty perform as good as it looks,Overall, great for local stations, and very easy to put in a shirt pocket for the ball game or a walk in the park","positive":1},{"review":"  I wanted to get a radio that had both AM FM abilities, plus the SW abilities are an added bonus, and fun to sometimes play with, as I worked 3rd shift for the last 10 years of my 35 years plus of my career in a steel melting shop, for the investment casting facility,  Well done","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio is perfect for me to carry in my pocket or lay beside in bed, listening to talk or sports (when that resumes), I paid mid-$20s on Amazon","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this radio to replace a (very) old AM FM transistor radio that was losing sound quality and reception sensitivity,  That would really be a plus","positive":1},{"review":"  I am so totally surprised at this radio's quality and simplicity, a price you just can't beat","positive":1},{"review":"  Update: August 2019, Picture attached compared to the Galaxy Note","positive":1},{"review":"  I started out really liking this radio,  How can a company manufacture a radio like this and not realize the display is crap in daylight","positive":0},{"review":"  My first (and likely last) Eton radio,Crane for small portable radios, their construction seems to be considerably better than this proved to be","positive":0},{"review":"  Cons,I have a Grundig 100 PE that works far better on SW and audio sounds much better","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this radio last year, but the radio did not last, that's the latest update,  For 2 x AAA batteries, you can simply find those anywhere and you can use your own rechargeable batteries to run this radio receiver","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a very nice, radio with a fantastic thin form factor, Get a Sangean 200X (or whatever it's called) instead - their radios are top notch (however be warned Sangean's belt clips completely suck - they break easily)","positive":0},{"review":"  I had high hopes for this radio but was disappointed,On the plus side, its small and compact with a nice appear and looks like it would fit into a shirt pocket","positive":0},{"review":"  I love the look of this radio,  But if you're like me and purchase it primarily to use without headphones, there are much better (pretty much ANY) radios out there","positive":0},{"review":"  Love the radio, and the carrying case,","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought the mini model after seeing a friends and liked the size and the digital scan for tuning, If you are looking for a portable SW radio  i suggest this one Tecsun PL-360 on Amazon and linked below","positive":0},{"review":"  Quite a disappointment from what I consider a decent manufacturer,For me all the bells and whistles could not overcome the primary function of a radio, that being to be comfortable to listen to","positive":0},{"review":"  I like this radio, Just hold the scan button down, it will tune to the next station that is strong enough to receive","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a really amazing little radio, I change it every once in a while when the tape gets ugly","positive":1},{"review":"  Works well,  Looking forward to many years of future use out of these little troopers","positive":1},{"review":"  Surprised at the super quality of this radio, Dropped it once while dog walking and it survived unscathed","positive":1},{"review":"  I have owned five different radios and non of them would pull in AM stations in the back of my cargo van except this one, I had it in my shirt pocket go on and run the batteries down because I did not know it was on","positive":1},{"review":"  First \" Forget all negative comments \" this little radio is unbelievable \" WOW \" just on its own it's the best pocket radio i have ever had, but i put my bows headphones on and it BLASTED ME TO ANOUTHER PLANET the stereo is like a $ 300,big smile","positive":1},{"review":"  I am most impressed by this little (mini) radio,  I should add that you can attach an extension aerial just by plugging it into the earphone jack, but not so far as to disconnect the speaker","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent receiver, Well done overall, and recommend it","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio came with a nice pouch to keep it safe from scratches and so on, Good money spent","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio is amazing, it super well built , great fit and finish, If your looking for a great small radio and don't want to pay seventy dollars for a c crane pocket, then this is your radio","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice form factor for taking with you on the go, This one chewed up batteries in a couple of weeks","positive":0},{"review":"  First of all, the compactness and sound go hand in hand, which was expected,","positive":0},{"review":"  I cannot make it stay in the ON position, I would like to exchange it but do not know how","positive":0},{"review":"  TERRIBLE,  Buy something else","positive":0},{"review":"  This was my second one and with both I had the same problem,  At that point you cannot change or reduce the volume and you don't enjoy it anymore","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this unit based on Eton's good brand reputation but I was very disappointed at the receiver sensitivity in the FM band, I am very close to the station and still get lousy reception and interference","positive":0},{"review":"  It let me down in a number of ways,It will be a backup in case of power outages, but as a daily driver - there's better choices","positive":0},{"review":"  Received this radio with a couple of other items combined in a strong sturdy box well protected,radio has a nice look and feel about it,it has better tuning steps compared to the smaller Eton mini,also when scanning it holds on to a station for a couple of seconds before proceeding to the next,the Eton mini just stops on the station and you must reengage the tuning scan,I just hope I can get a few decent years of listening from this radio without problems arrising","positive":0},{"review":"  It has to be reset by removing the batteries, I use an AMAZON FIRE 6 and an app for that","positive":0},{"review":"  Review update, it seems like a very good radio so I'm rate rating it at 4 stars","positive":0},{"review":"  very sensitive little radio,","positive":1},{"review":"  The fact that is looks like a sleek smartphone really drew me to this radio,The telescoping antenna is a little flimsy, so you have to really be careful when its fully extended","positive":1},{"review":"  11 11 2018, thanks","positive":1},{"review":"  PRO: Small and light, good sensitivity and selectivity -- and very dependent upon an antenna for shortwave, Probably asking too much to expect a solid DX (shortwave) radio, though with a strong antenna, it probably would be okay","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s slim, looks and feels great, and frankly I like and use it actually a whole lot kore than I expected I would,By the way, blacj and silver Eton Grundig edition","positive":1},{"review":"  Love the design, If you are looking for a nice little radio that is pleasant to carry around and have for occasional listening or emergencies, this is a good one","positive":1},{"review":"  Gorgeous Handheld Radio with Digital Scan Tuning, The sound from the speaker is adequate for a portable, but plug in a set of Koss Porta-Pros, and you are going to really enjoy your radio listening","positive":1},{"review":"  I consider myself a pretty knowledgeable person about pocket-size radios as I own several brands of them, It's a perfect size for listening on the go","positive":1},{"review":"  Great little emergency radio, Sound quality is ok for its size","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a wonderful little radio - but make sure you get the \"Grundig Edition\" (I got it by sheer luck and for a great price [$25] when I ordered a used one from Amazon) because the one shown here is NOT THE SAME, :) It will be a flexible AC adapter solution for many other devices","positive":1},{"review":"  The Eton Mini Compact Seems like a well-built product, and I like the slim form factor, but the shortwave tuning is useless, I also found the sound to be thin and tinny, more so than other radios in this class","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought my first eton mini radio a few months ago, I will not be able to exchange this radio as it was past the return date by four days","positive":0},{"review":"  After six weeks of use, the name-brand batteries corroded in the radio, This device has awesome reception, built-in speaker, and digital tuning but falls extremely short in reliability","positive":0},{"review":"  It's a great little radio which met all of my expectations and beyond, Make sure you've got lots of batteries on hand","positive":0},{"review":"  I guess for 20 bucks it's OK, Seems well built","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this because it said RDS,","positive":0},{"review":"  Don`t waste your time with this piece of junk, Stick with the quality Sangean line","positive":0},{"review":"  Low volume quality of these speakers isn`t good,  Go with sangean","positive":0},{"review":"  Two radios returned because AM didn't work at all -- no stations found,  FM was OK, but the radio requires Li ion or alkaline batteries and eats them more quickly than my similar Sangean","positive":0},{"review":"  I returned the first one that didn't work out of the box, the second worked for about a week and then failed,  Avoid","positive":0},{"review":"  For old guys like me who still prefer over-the-air radio to satellite or internet radio, it can be hard to find a good portable radio these days,  It also has decent range, and it's thin profile is a plus","positive":1},{"review":"  I rate this radio with 5 stars because it gets better reception on FM than any radio I have,  I highly recommend this Eton radio","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0I own the Tecsun PL660 and the 360,UPDATE: the customer service answered my email indicating that this was a sign of drained batteries","positive":1},{"review":"  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality, given the low price,  You really can't go wrong with this one","positive":1},{"review":"  this radio is great for those who listen to Coast to Coast am, at midnight (or any talk radio on am), it doesn't fade in and out like a regular transistor radio, it is compact , and has a timer setting for 4 different times to save your battery from dying , so if you go to sleep listening to the radio it will go off so your batteries don't die as often as a regular old school radio, it has a head phone jack ,,, really worth every dime,","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice radio and excellent sound with the phones,  Reception is very good and the size is perfect","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this because I wanted a very small radio with AM FM and short wave coverage, something that I could slip into a jeans pocket and forget it was there until I pulled it out to listen,  But it offers something they can't, true portability","positive":1},{"review":"  Really nice little rig that I carry around in my briefcase or backpack,","positive":1},{"review":"  I am very happy with this product, It does a good job picking up stations even with the antenna down and indoors","positive":1},{"review":"  Great radio,  Totally satisfied","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s fine if you just want a nice AM FM radio, You can get a nice Sony AM FM radio for half the cost","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a very cheap quality product, with poor signal reception and looks like a toy, Please don't ever purchase this","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked for two weeks, ate three pairs of AAA batteries during that time, then broke, Every time the radio is turned on it immediately turns off after half a second","positive":0},{"review":"  reception ok,sound quality is terrible","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s a cheap radio, You get what you pay for","positive":0},{"review":"  Updating from my previous slagging off (below)The seek function is absolutely terrible, and that's what I was using to try to tune previously,  It doesn't, so you look like you're trying to divine water whenever you're using it","positive":0},{"review":"  This radio is good on pick up FM signals, but for AM is a bit hard maybe due to my location, the tunning knob is smooth, speaker is okay, Compare to my old mini Grundig 100PE, this one is still one step behind regarding to picking signal and audio quality","positive":0},{"review":"  Sw function is junk, doesnt work, Overpriced","positive":0},{"review":"  Adequate pocket radio, A little heftier than the mini, but with better sound and reception capabilities","positive":0},{"review":"  Needed a small radio with an alarm, Take a look at the Tecsun PL-118 too - no MP3, but it is a DSP radio, pulls in channels really well, does have an alarm and audio is fine","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0Note: Requires 3 AA batteries,  And I am sorry for lying to you just now","positive":1},{"review":"  We are campers, much better than a flashlight in those situations, as they are directional light and these light up a room quite well","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0This lantern is compact in size and light weight, It is great for camping, power outages, and prepping","positive":1},{"review":"  I can't  say enough good things about these mini L,I did read some reviews on other brands and read comments about some of the ones with the metal bases, rusting up after contact with moisture","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0I dropped it and it didn't break, These are simple straight forward Lanterns","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought 3, 2 packs of these for Christmas gifts,  everyone loved them and they all worked perfectly,  I highly recommend these","positive":1},{"review":"  Insanely bright, Picture is of one open and one closed next to a normal sized playing card","positive":1},{"review":"  Decent brightness and very rugged design,  These are slightly less bright than our Coleman propane light, fitting well with our intended use","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought these for camping, Oh, and they were much less $ then some others I saw","positive":1},{"review":"  I had bought these without really looking at the full product specifications,  These are incredibly bright and will illuminate much better than what I had in mind when I made the initial purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  For some reason this company, VONT, has started spam emailing me recently even though I bought this lantern almost a year ago,As for the lantern, it worked OK for a while then the LED's started flickering making the thing useless","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm bought a lantern from the dollar store for a dollar it is lasted twice as long, Instead just as bright as both of these have already burned through the same batteries I am using and I ni-mh and nicd rechargeable batteries these Lanterns have proven to go dead the first one was less than 15 minutes on the n i MH the other one lasted longer maybe 30 to 45 minutes on nicd I don't recommend","positive":0},{"review":"  I've used this twice now and I have some mixed feelings on this luxury item,Thanks for reading","positive":0},{"review":"  ok, they are bright,  If you hang the light by its handle, or even just toss it in a bag, you cannot guarantee that they will stay off, killing the batteries","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought the two pack,Returned","positive":0},{"review":"  PROS:  Installing the batteries is easy, the pull-out design is simple to use, tested it with rechargeable batteries and it provided good light, and it is compact for emergency storage, In addition, we suggest purchasing one other brand of lantern that is a more expensive and more reliable","positive":0},{"review":"  Don't buy this,  Unfortunately, I didn't open and check these out when they arrived and the return window has closed","positive":0},{"review":"  These lamps are a good value, and I bought the two-pack on sale, Would have preferred they made the light hue warmer and more consistent with an old fashioned oil or incandescent lamp","positive":0},{"review":"  These things are so dim, This is dollar store level quality junk","positive":0},{"review":"  The lantern was light weight and bright, BUT, one lantern the bottom part fell down while holding it walking at the second use, and same thing happened another one at its third use,  Do not buy","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered these lanterns in preparation for hurricane Matthew, For such a low price I would urge anyone to use foresight and purchase this product and be prepared","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been using these lanterns for the past couple of months from the coast of Santa Barbara to the desert in Johnson Valley and they have held up so well, Very happy with this product","positive":1},{"review":"  These are such great little lights and they brought me luck, I will use my little power angels camping soon","positive":1},{"review":"  My daughter-in-law gave me one for Christmas last year, Thank you","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently purchased this due to the impending PG&E electricity shut downs in Northern California due to our fire season, which includes wind gusts from 30-60 mph, This is truly convenient and a really great product (I have purchased 3 more sets and given one away)","positive":1},{"review":"  Two of these helped get me through 7 days without power after Hurricane Florence last year, These are good lights, but make sure you follow their registration instructions","positive":1},{"review":"  We just received these today July 24th 2017,Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything I can do for you =)Have an awesome day","positive":1},{"review":"  These are great, I will edit down the line on durability and battery life","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought these recently for a camping trip, I'd buy these again","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this set of lanterns in preparation for Hurricane Irma and they were delivered 2 days before it hit my area, the size makes them portable and convenient to store","positive":1},{"review":"  We purchased these ahead of hurricane season in Texas,  easy for kids to use","positive":1},{"review":"  Oct 2018 Update*****These are wicked bright,Seller was very nice and product is in flawless condition","positive":1},{"review":"  I just went through hurricane Sally and had purchased these before it hit because I have lame flashlights and no candles,","positive":1},{"review":"  These are  very nice quality, I will pick 2 more up next hurricane season","positive":1},{"review":"  I am currently writing this from the middle of Iowa, three days after the derecho hit,Buy this before the derecho comes for you","positive":1},{"review":"  We live in Florida and we never know when storms will knock out our power, Batteries do not come with the lanterns","positive":1},{"review":"  I received two lanterns with batteries, I keep mine ready in case of power failure, and take a couple when I go camping, just to have that extra light available","positive":1},{"review":"  They are not perfect, but I like them so well that I'm going to give 5 stars anyway,TBW I have two other brands of rechargeables and they work perfect without the modification","positive":1},{"review":"  These work fantastically,However, for simply illuminating a larger area, these are excellent","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this particular set of lanterns not only because of the very favorable reviews,4 stars - had to take off one because of the missing batteries false advertisement","positive":1},{"review":"  When unboxing items they looked to be good quality, The other lantern seems to work as it should","positive":0},{"review":"  when I first recieved this lamp I tested it out and was amazed,do not buy, it will cost you an arm and a leg in battery replacements","positive":0},{"review":"  These lights are much smaller than I expected,  I planned to buy more if I like these but I WON'T BE BUYING MORE","positive":0},{"review":"  These bad chickens are bright as bright can be, sigh","positive":0},{"review":"  Was everything to love when I took the pair out of the box, Felt disposable a waste of money if I have to keep changing batteries for such a short use","positive":0},{"review":"  Not very rugged,  Just don't drop it","positive":0},{"review":"  I haven`t had or used the product enough to give any info pertaining to the battery life, If I didn`t take one of the batteries out of that lantern for certain the battery life would have been short lived","positive":0},{"review":"  it was very compact, overall quality of the product is quite good, the handles are nice, and while the light is very bright, it's not very even so I didn't find it particularly useful for camping for doing task oriented things,","positive":0},{"review":"  Upon initial inspection of the product I purchased I realized one of the two lanterns was broken, Regardless of the cost of the product those type of steps shouldn`t have to be taken to insure product usability","positive":0},{"review":"  Only when starting directly at it,  So OK, and good for the cost, just was a bit disappointing","positive":0},{"review":"  After reviewing several other products I purchased the Vont 2 Pack LED camping lantern package,  Edward,  (Lexington, SC)","positive":1},{"review":"  These are really wonderful, powerful lights and their battery life is better than I expected, Definitely recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  My son let me borrow his lights for camping so I decided to purchase my own set, I would purchase again","positive":1},{"review":"  After surviving the big Northern California power outage for 90 hours (\ud83d\ude2d) we quickly went to Amazon to stock up on supplies we needed an upgrade on,","positive":1},{"review":"  I received these for free but I did not need to leave a review, I'll update the review if anything comes up after time but all good for now","positive":1},{"review":"  I have used one of these nearly daily for one month,  SWEET","positive":1},{"review":"  We purchased these lanterns to use outside around our firepit,  We'll see how long the batteries last but so far so good","positive":1},{"review":"  Great little lanterns, I'm glad to have these as backup when the power goes out, for overnight camping trips and to help me grill at night","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought these lanterns based on reviews and price, not for camping but for home use in case of a prolonged power outage, They are blindingly bright even when partially open","positive":1},{"review":"  Just in time, One less worry as I prepare for this category 5 storm","positive":1},{"review":"  Very bright and light weight, Lanterns are water tight so I'm not sure how to fix the inner wall","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing is a piece of Chinese garbage, I give zero stars, Sounds like good advice to me","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered a two pack of these lanterns to have for power outages,  Too bad there wasn't a bit more quality in the manufacture and accuracy in what is included with the lights","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0I LOVE these little lanterns, they`re perfect for a go bag and just to have in the house in case you lose power","positive":0},{"review":"  It is great for camping and very easy to carry, Overall it is great for camping but it could be better","positive":0},{"review":"  I can't tell about battery life because I just received the product, but since it's LED I'll assume it's good or very good, It's not","positive":0},{"review":"  Up until last night, I liked everything about these lanterns,  After all, it is made for outdoor use and accidents like mine are bound to happen","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this and a slightly more expensive Brionec Rechargeable LED latern 2 pack, So do yourself a favor and go with the other, unless you want the absolute cheapest decent light, which is this Vont option","positive":0},{"review":"  These are nifty little lamps that turn on when you extend the lamp by pulling it apart, I really wanted this to work but the glare is just too much","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought these because of the high customer reviews,I kept them because they were inexpensive and good for lighting up a room Incase of power outages","positive":0},{"review":"  I spent about a month looking for a good mid-range budget laptop with both a decent CPU and an SSD drive,I wish I could make this product easier to find for people looking to get a midrange laptop","positive":1},{"review":"WARNING: You are about to read what is likely going to be the most nitpicky review of your life, I would recommend this product as a good midpoint between an ultraportable and a traditional laptop for a reasonable price","positive":1},{"review":"  All of the perks that are claimed in the product description ring true,  I have a thousand browsers and office apps open at once and it doesn't slow down, which makes it great for me","positive":1},{"review":"  So far the best laptop that I have ever owned, I am seriously not disappointed in the least with my purchase","positive":1},{"review":"  It's really sleek out of the box, Other than that, it was my first real investment during college and I don't regret it","positive":1},{"review":"  I have owned Asus laptops previously and have been very pleased, She may just get a separate webcam","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a Mac user for the past 16 years and I needed a Windows based laptop for work,  I do use a wireless mouse since the tracking pad is not what I am use to - not up a Mac but I can live with it","positive":1},{"review":"  Have had it for a few months now, and I love it, Perfect for our homeschool family needs, so I will definitely be looking for another one when we need an additional laptop next year","positive":1},{"review":"  I have used this laptop for the last two years as my daily laptop at work, Five stars because it fulfilled expectations","positive":1},{"review":"  Its been 4+ months since I've purchased this laptop, These guys are fantastic machines","positive":1},{"review":"  I am writing this review for anyone who does not know much about laptops, the ASUS F556UA-AS54 laptop is highly capable due to the Intel i5 processor (Just under Intel's top-tier i7 processor), and 8GBs of random access memory (RAM),Overall this laptop is good for the money initially, I am just scared I like have to invest in a new one soon because of how fragile it is","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this computer in August 2016, I will steer clear of all ASUS products in the future and would urge others to do the same","positive":0},{"review":"  My review after a year of use, In short, this is an okay laptop","positive":0},{"review":"  UPDATE: Got my battery replaced,  I hardly ever right in reviews, but figured I had some helpful advice for everyone -- Don't buy Asus laptop it has a design defect with the battery","positive":0},{"review":"  Would've liked to give it a 5, everything is pretty impressive except that the live video from camera was too choppy to accept, both when tested with camera app and Skype, This is the first ASUS laptop that I'm not happy with (I had three)","positive":0},{"review":"  I really wanted to love this laptop, However, after much thought, I am returning","positive":0},{"review":"  Do not buy used laptops,I ended up buying an new laptop from acer","positive":0},{"review":"  disappointed, I am connected to the internet, but unable to use IE or chrome","positive":0},{"review":"  A serviceable, okay laptop,  For the price, this computer is okay and does what you would expect in this price range","positive":0},{"review":"  Keys fell off, No gaming as she is a violinist","positive":0},{"review":"  Asus is one of my recommended brands for consumer laptops next to Dell and Lenovo, I would recommend pairing this with Bitdefender Total Security 2017 or Kaspersky Labs for security","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a really nice value for what you get, You really get a lot for your money, and I've been quite happy despite those gripes","positive":1},{"review":"  The Asus F556-AS54 provides excellent performance for its price, I give it a 4 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great laptop for general use","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this for my daughter who is a high school junior and will be leaving next year for college, I would definitely purchase another ASUS","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this computer for my small business, And I have been impressed with the battery life and sound of the computer","positive":1},{"review":"  We've had this laptop for a couple months now and we really like it,  It's still looking good even with a 10 year old user on it daily and holds a charge well","positive":1},{"review":"  Just received this computer and after a few days use, I'd say I definitely like it :) Spent a couple weeks comparing many computers - ended up paying a bit more than I had planned on it but worth it due to the specs of the computer - and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't swayed by the beautiful color :) I was surprised by how good the speakers are - my last laptop had Beats speakers and they weren't as good, Overall I think its a good product and hope it will stand the test of time","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this used-really good condition about 6 months ago, the 'b' button sticks a bit which is probably why it was originally returned, That's way overpriced in my opinion, but if you can find a new one around $500-600 in 2017 then it's worth it","positive":1},{"review":"  Great laptophandles windows task with a

etc","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop before starting grad school, Thankfully this all happened within the 30-day return window","positive":0},{"review":"  The wifi adapter - Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 - repeatedly dropped connection and required restarting,  Should have just got that to begin with","positive":0},{"review":"  It's an OK laptop, but I might not choose ASUS for my next one,All in all, it seems like a decent choice so far (will update if anything changes) but for my next one I'll probably go back to Dell","positive":0},{"review":"  I've always liked ASUS products because they are well made,  I long for W7","positive":0},{"review":"  Laptop worked great except that keyboard had issues with the top left \"keys\",  Otherwise, it's fine","positive":0},{"review":"  Fan is making a very bad noise,","positive":0},{"review":"  Screen started flickering last week, I feel like I wasted money on this one","positive":0},{"review":"  Have used it only 2 weeks and battery does not charge,  My mistake for purchasing","positive":0},{"review":"  The screen is just great,That's it, but it's a serious pain in the backside so the new unit loses two stars for that","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought the computer 5 months ago and recently started receiving an error that my Windows 10 Home Edition was going to expire,","positive":0},{"review":"  As advertized,it is a very nice laptop,Again this laptop is worth your  money","positive":1},{"review":"  I just received this today and so far its great, is super fast, I love the color of it and the texture of the keyboard and the layout is great, I was looking for a new laptop since mine is about four or so years old and has stopped connecting all that well to the internet and the keyboard was starting to go as well and seeing as I am a college student and a writer on the side I need my keyboard to work","positive":1},{"review":"  Although I am not a laptop guru, I do use my laptop quite often and spent quite some time picking out the right one, Regardless, overall, this is a good laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this laptop for about a week now and I've found it to be a really solid computer for the price,It doesn't have the same beauty as a Mac, but at the price they are selling this one at I couldn't care less","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm not a super tech-literate person, but I did do a bit of research before I chose this laptop,  I'm so happy with it that my husband is considering it to replace his current laptop as well","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop is the best there is out there for it's price, The only cons ( which arent really a big deal ) are: after years of usage the battery duration becomes just a LITTLE shorter, but that's normal in pretty much every laptop, also when the battery percentage reaches around 10 % it starts to lag a little bit and that's when you have to plug in the charger and problem solved, OTHER thant that this laptops is PERFECT for someone who is not an engineer or an animator and loves speed and responsiveness","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my 2nd Asus laptop, the first of which lasted for 3 years (and still works beautifully) before I decided to upgrade to this unit,  I got the SSD HD even though it had less storage because I read how much cooler and faster it ran than a HDD drive","positive":1},{"review":"  Slim and sleek, I do like the numbers on the side for quick entry, as I've only had that with desktop keyboards and not laptops","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchasing the ASUS F556UA is one of the best buying decisions you will ever make, ASUS has done and continues to do an excellent job in the mid to upper quality computer space, with the F556UA being no exception","positive":1},{"review":"  The short of it is, for the price, everything works as I expect, Have not had any unexpected crashes or hardware issues yet","positive":1},{"review":"  Good: Works well when it charges, Camera is really poor quality","positive":0},{"review":"  I got a used one when it was supose to be new,","positive":0},{"review":"  It is a good product but poor customer support, now getting WHEA logger event17 error with random restart since windows 10 update","positive":0},{"review":"  This computer if VERY fast & I love that,  Its really unfortunate","positive":0},{"review":"  The description for this laptop said that the box had damage but that the computer itself was not damaged, The screen has a few scratches right in the middle of the display","positive":0},{"review":"  Had glitches, slow start up, terrible internet connectivity, Returned it","positive":0},{"review":"  Sound issue from the beginning (headphones worked but hours of troubleshooting later,  I CAN however recommend to Asus that they change their name to Issues","positive":0},{"review":"  The computer is really beautiful, slim, fast, BUT the wifi sucks, I didn't have issues with my older laptop, and the two finger scrolling gets old fast,","positive":0},{"review":"  Computer crashed repeatedly and I need it for work, extremely agitating,","positive":0},{"review":"  I honestly want to love this laptop but even with such good spec at such a good price, I have to return it,  By the way,  the case is all plastic and if you press on the bottom part you will heard popping sound from the dented plastic","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laptop in May of 2016, It would have been nice if this laptop had a lighted keyboard, but all in all a solid laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a student and do not need to use too many heavy software on my laptop, Laptop starts up very very quick - which is a huge positive","positive":1},{"review":"  Besides being made of a flimsy plastic this computer is fantastic, I already had an SD card USB adapter thought so no harm no foul","positive":1},{"review":"  The Asus F556UA-AS54 is an amazing product for the price,  But for $550 you are getting a great deal and a decent quality laptop","positive":1},{"review":"  So far so good, So far the customer has been very happy","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm seeing some bad reviews about this ASUS here , I highly recommend this if you are on a budget","positive":1},{"review":"  Chose this laptop over an i7 1TB HDD ASUS Laptop, I'm 2 months into owning, no complaints","positive":1},{"review":"  Yeah,The sound issue made this lose a star","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for my son to use for school,

It arrived promptly and well packaged and offline performance was smooth,I am the process of returning this, but as offline performance was good and I want to give the brand another shot, I will likely be looking for another ASUS laptop to replace it","positive":0},{"review":"  Sadly, Microsoft's choice to force Windows 10 updates on users without any ability to choose which individual parts to block or accept renders this machine's internal USB hub useless,  Tech support at ASUS was friendly and wanted to be helpful, but was ultimately unable to offer a solution","positive":0},{"review":"  Garbage computer, Worst money we ever spent","positive":0},{"review":"  Computer was corrupted, Stopped working after a few weeks","positive":0},{"review":"

a gift for disabled family members who lived in California area where PG&E turned off power for days,  Dependable and worth every penny","positive":1},{"review":"  I am very happy to get this radio, Great value and would recommend","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is superb,This is a must-pack item if you plan to spend more than12 hours in the wilderness or you believe one day the zombies

I  go to the drive-in movies because I have a pushbutton car it doesn`t stay on it will turn itself off and you have to start it too many times to enjoy the movie but I get all 1980s retro radio C batteries work just fine","positive":1},{"review":"  When Hurricane Dorian was headed our way I took out our hurricane kit to double check everything only to discover our red cross radio was no longer usable,  Solar power is a must these days and were happy to have this in our kit","positive":1},{"review":"  Only con I can find is the sound quality isnt great (but it's not horrible), the led lights

emergency","positive":1},{"review":"  The product worked right away - on receipt, so that was nice,  2 days without power is trying to say the least","positive":1},{"review":"  I have purchased an
