# NLP_binary_classification
In this work, we will train a NLP classification model based on Amazon customers'review.
The objective is to build a model able to identify positive and negative comments.
In this repository, you will find :
* scrapping_model.ipynb : Notebook for scrapping comments from amazon and create labels ('positive'/ 'negative')
* nlp_model_module.ipynb : Notebook for classification model training (neural network : The order of words is not considered)
* nlp_sequence_model_module.ipynb : Notebook for classification LSTM model training (sequence model : The order of words is considered)
